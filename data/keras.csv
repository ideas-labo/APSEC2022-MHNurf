Both validation and training sets have the same number of examples.

The two phases take the same time with a 18 cores Xeon CPU, but validation takes 4 times the training time with Intel Phi architeclure (and tensorflow MKL binary).

I think/suspect that model evaluation for validation calculation does not take advantage of parallelization/multi-threading. This could be the core of the problem. Please check.

5,keras,4108,closed,Different behavior with custom loss function.,"Hi,

I wrote a custom loss function that just uses the built-in binary crossentropy loss:



However, the behavior is different when I use this function instead of passing 'binary_crossentropy' to the model's compile method. This function yields worse results. I suspect it might be a numerical problem but I don't know how to fix it.

In [this gist,](https://gist.github.com/EhsanEI/90203acd0026d915699a7cbb9af584a9) I get ~99% validation accuracy on MNIST with the built-in function and ~96% validation accuracy with my_loss after the first epoch. The difference is much bigger on my own dataset.

The tensorflow.keras.backend.eval() function produces a numpy array from a tensor result. I slightly modified your test code and found that the results from all loss functions were nearly identical. The only difference was for the elements where both y_true and y_pred were zero. There is  a 1.9e-8 difference between those elements of loss1 and loss2. This is due to the slightly different way the binary cross-entropy function is written in tensorflow. You can see the difference at [this link](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/backend.py#L4728).\r\n\r\nI added a loss_tensor3 function that calculates the binary cross-entropy the same way tensorflow does.

6,keras,4633,closed,Theano memory issues. ,"Hello there, 

I don't have an exact message on me now as I am in the middle of training my model under TF but this is an issue i've had on two setups:

Setup 1: 32Gb RAM, no GPU
Setup 2: p2.xlarge instance - 60GB RAM, 1/2 Tesla K80

Model goes like this: LSTM 2, LSTM16, LSTM8, Dense1 ( but this happens on any lstm/gru network)

What happens there roughly is theano invokes g++ and each compilation blows up (OOM)
What happens there with TF, it plateaus on 35GB of memory and runs happily, so even though Setup 1 might be out of question (leave optimization), Setup 2 works like a charm.

### Description

I used the same pre-trained keras model (a LeNet structure on fashion-mnist datasets) on tensorflow and theano backends respectively, and noticed that there is a big difference between the two backends. The accuracy on tensorflow is 91.6% while the accuracy on theano is just 40.6%.

![acc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17698785/58078171-abfebd00-7be0-11e9-8980-a3e2686cac16.png)

The prediction results on the two backends are shown as below, respectively:

![tensorflow-result](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17698785/58078197-bcaf3300-7be0-11e9-91a5-2ad46142c1ef.png)

Based on the results, the problem seems to occur at the backend of Theano. I also tried to localize the problem, and found that the inconsistency may happen at the first layer of the model, which is a convolutional layer:


I compared the outputs of the layer from the two backends, and found that many values are not close (or the same).

This layer is also used in many other models but there is no such inconsistency. Therefore, I suspect this problem happens under some specific context (such as parameters). In particular, I constructed a model only with this layer (using the same parameters and shuffling the weights), and the inconsistency still exists.

I attched the code and the pretrained model (.h5 file) to help reproduce this inconsistency.

**Things I have tried:**

I have tried on several machines with different hardware and Ubuntu versions, with different combinations of Keras (1.0.7, 1.0.8, latest commit) & Theano (0.8.2 & latest commit) versions, and both CPU and GPU training - with the same result in every case.

I've tried removing the sigmoid activation and optimising MSE instead, but that results in a loss about 10 digits long. I've tried having a single dense neuron with no activation (and other various simplified architecures), and I've tried several different optimizers (Adam, sgd, rmsprop). No matter how I change the model, I cannot seem to get anything else.

I've verified that there are no NaNs or Infs in the matrix, and that the y values are binary. The matrix passed to Keras is a numpy array.

Any help would be very much appreciated, as I have been labouring over this problem for hours without being able to fix it.

I recently bought a second GPU in order to speed up my neural network computations. I use Keras 2.2.2 with  Tensorflow 1.9.0. When I run a normal model it is sped up by one GPU as might be expected. It makes my model run about 60 times faster compared to the CPU (AMD 1950X).


When I use the instruction  the combined power of both cards results in a slowdown by about a **factor 100**. That happens to all my models: RNN, CNN and Dense. Both cards seem to work, however, they seem to alternate the work between each other. Also the CPU activity does increase quite a lot. When using both cards the CPU activity of one core is about 50%, using one card this is about 8%-10%. 

When selecting each GPU separately by using  the usual speed up occurs. I cannot use multi_gpu_model in that case. When I select both GPU窶冱 with   and multi_gpu_model then the slow down occurs. I printed the topology (see below) but could not find anything strange, but I am far from an expert on this. 


This is not the same issue as issue #9204. That issue discusses why some models cause some slowdown when using multiple GPU's. As far as I can see my issue is not related to any specific model.  
Does anyone have an idea what exactly is wrong in my setup?

Keras 2.2.2, Tensorflow 1.9.0, python 3.5.5, Ubuntu Mate 18.04 and Nvidia drivers 390.48 (same problems with Ubuntu Mate 16.04.4 and Nvidia drivers 390.130).

Below is some simple MNIST code that I used to benchmark my setup.

",,"[""I'm not 100% confident about my answer, but I ran into this issue, my mentor suggested it's because, only for really huge batch sizes (ex:256, 512) you are going to see speed improvement, if for smaller batches it's just a lot of time for the CPU to split batches and dump them into the GPUs.\r\nBut still, 505 secs on two GPUs really makes me ponder on what's going on."", 'Can you try a batch size of 512 just to see if it\'s a communication bottleneck happening?\r\n\r\nAlso, you should build your model on CPU instead since you don\'t have NVLink:\r\n```\r\n# multi-gpu model\r\nimport tensorflow as tf\r\nfrom keras.utils.training_utils import multi_gpu_model\r\n\r\nwith tf.device(""/cpu:0""):\r\n\t\t# initialize the model\r\n\t\tmodel = XXX\r\n\t\r\n# make the model parallel\r\nparallel_model = multi_gpu_model(model, gpus=2)\r\nparallel_model.compile()\r\n```', 'Thank you both for your suggestions. Both the batch size increase and building the model on CPU helped me to solve the problem. I did some experiments for the MNIST code and tabled the results:\r\n```\r\n                Built on CPU\r\nbs   1GPU 2GPU  1GPU 2GPU\r\n  64 5.88   -     40 9.06\r\n 128 3.55  499    36 5.79\r\n 512 2.32  127    35 2.30\r\n1024 2.31   64    34 1.21\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that for this simple model the break even in speed is reached for a batch size of 512. With a batch size of 1024 I get the about factor two speedup I had hoped for by buying this extra card.

What I should have done is also measure the accuracy of the computations to see whether the parameters chosen have impact on the results. I found out though, that when all remains equal GRU results in a better accuracy per epoch for this task than LSTM.\r\n\r\nAs to NVLink: am I right to guess that it is a kind of hardware connection and that it is not available for my ""cheapo"" cards like the 1080Ti?

 We are implementing a deep learning model for diabetic retinopathy detection (**binary classification**) using the data set of fundus photographs provided by [this Kaggle competition][2]. We are using **Keras 2.0** with **Tensorflow** backend.

As the data set is too big to fit in memory, we are using , with  randomly taking images from training and validation folders:

    # TRAIN THE MODEL
    model.fit_generator(
        train_generator,
        steps_per_epoch= train_generator.samples // training_batch_size,
        epochs=int(config['training']['epochs']),
        validation_data=validation_generator,
        validation_steps= validation_generator.samples // validation_batch_size,
        class_weight=None)

Our CNN architecture is VGG16 with dropout = 0.5 in the last two fully connected layers, batch normalization only before the first fully connected layer, and data augmentation (consisting on flipping the images horizontally and vertically). Our training and validation samples are normalized using the training set mean and standard deviation. Batch size is 32. Our activation is a  and the loss function is the . [You can find our implementation in Github][3]

It definitely has nothing to do with overfitting, as we tried with a highly regularized model and the behavior was quite the same. **Is it related with the sampling from the validation set?** Has any of you had a similar problem before?

20,keras,11858,closed,BatchNormalization produces NaN weights without NaN loss,"Hi,

Not sure this can be labelled as a bug, but it's problematic. BatchNormalization seems to silently produce NaN weights when training a  if the training dataset size is not a multiple of .

For example, with a training dataset (1825, 401, 401, 3), validation dataset (140, 401, 401, 3), , , 



The training apparently goes fine



but the weights have NaNs, e.g.



I think this happens because the training dataset of 1825 gets split into sets of . So there's going to be a set of 1 training image, and maybe that doesn't work with BatchNormalization.

When running under both Keras 2.1.2 as well as Keras from GitHub master the validation accuracy achieved in the dogs vs. cats example in Chapter 5.3 of the DL w/Python book (https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks/blob/master/5.3-using-a-pretrained-convnet.ipynb) is ~ 90%.

However, the validation accuracy when running under Keras 2.0.9 is ~ 96%.

The code (as well as the cats vs. dogs images) required to reproduce this is in the following GitHub repo (the script is also inline below):

https://github.com/jjallaire/keras-vgg16-accuracy

One other noteworthy thing is that with Keras 2.1.2 case training takes ~ 22 seconds/epoch whereas with Keras 2.0.9 it's ~ 50 seconds per epoch (this on an Amazon p2.xlarge instance).

22,keras,5720,closed,Image Augmentation- flow - hanging forever and not training,"I am trying to train a segmentation network. I am running into issues when trying to use image augmentation. Below is attached my function that sets the generator, fits it (though I dont think I really need to), it then zips the label and image generators. 

It is when trying to zip these that my program hangs and never moves on. Playing around it seems that it has to do with the flow function. Whenever I call the flow function it just runs on it's own indefinitely. 


I have made some changes to the image.py file to allow for 3D manipulations, but I have check/doublechecked / even gone back and re-implemented my changes in a clean copy of image.py  to make sure I wasn't changing anything that should effect this process. 
[image.py.zip](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/files/836158/image.py.zip)


I've attached a zip of my updated image.py. Most of the functions at the start are left as the 2D counterparts, its within the random_transform that most of the 3D manipulations are located. 

Does anyone have any thoughts? 

Thanks, 

Anthony.

If I change the input data from (5,10) --> (500,10) something changes?

I have noticed that when I use fit generator with pickle safe to True, number of workers > 1, and max generator queue > 2 the python processes accumulate memory leading to hanging of the execution due to no more available memory (I have 40GB of RAM).

This does not happening when setting pickle safe to False. 
",,"['The process should accumulate memory as the queue is being filled.

When I set `pickle_safe=True`, I find my memory is accumulating, which leads to memory out problem. However, I use fit generator with pickle safe to False, no memory error is raised.\n I wonder the reason why it happens.\n', ""I've run into the same thing and noticed that many child processes are being created (1 per training epoch) but those are not being joined after the epoch, resulting in a memory leak.\n"", 'I am facing the same problem. My data is about 167G and I used two processes which costs 123G+106G. I think the main problem is that the new batches are added to the multiprocessing queue which pickles the data.

You can also make this update be train-mode-only.\r\n\r\nSomething like;\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nclass MyDP(Layer):\r\n    def __init__(self, rate, **kwargs):\r\n       self.rate = rate\r\n       super(...).__init__(**kwargs)\r\n\r\n    def build(self, input_shape):\r\n       self.dropout_mask = self.add_weight(shape=input_shape, initializer='ones', trainable=False)\r\n\r\n   def call(self, inputs):\r\n      dropped =  K.in_train_phase(self.dropout_mask * inputs * ...)\r\n      if not self.updates:\r\n         self.add_update(self.dropout_mask, K.dropout(self.dropout_mask * 0 + 1, self.rate)\r\n     return droppped\r\n```\r\n\r\nWarning: untested, incomplete, etc"", ""I think that item 3 above (loss=4) is due to the fact that Dropout multiplies activations by `1/(1-p)` during training, a well-known trick to avoid dividing during inference). So that's correct.\r\n\r\nWith unsynchronized masks, shared Dropout layers are not actually shared in any meaningful way. I can't tell if it's a bug/misfeature in Keras or the TF backend (if so, I'll file the bug report there). Of course it could be impractical due to performance or architectural reasons, in which case it should be clearly documented.\r\n\r\nTo large degree this is an issue of mental model of shared layers - I (probably erroneously) thought that everything of physically collocated, so shared masks are automatic.\r\n\r\nUnshared masks were unexpected to me, and I came to this realization purely accidentally, while debugging Siamese network training. When fed identical data, two networks with supposedly shared everything, produce different final activations.\r\n\r\nApparently, I have multiple sources of stochasticity, which I resolve one-by-one. The ones I identified so far are `Dropout` and `BatchNormalization`, but there could be more.\r\n\r\nReplacing standard dropout layer with a custom one is awkward, because the base network is pretrained, so I'd need to do network surgery, which I am not entirely sure how to.\r\n\r\nBTW, setting `seed` does appear to work after all (there was a bug in my earlier version of the test).\r\n"", '`seed` also survives `save_model()/load_model()`, so that gives a workable workaround.', 'almost certainly not, since it would make no sense and would be a severe bug, not likely to go unnoticed.

I used the basic character-level seq2seq model [example](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/lstm_seq2seq.py) for French-to-English translation.

The accuracy measure seems to comparing the entire decoder output, i.e max_decoder_output_length.
and I would like the accuracy to represent only the characters till first occurrence of the stop character ('\n' in this case) and not compare the predicted output to padded target output.

For example:
Consider the example that gives a 63 character long decoder sequence:

i.e **decoder_target_output** is One Hot Representation of ( '' empty string represents a zero padded input vector)
['C', 'o', 'u', 'r', 'e', 'z', '\xe2', '\x80', '\xaf', '!', '\n', '', '', '', '' '', '', '', '', '', '', '' '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '' '', '', '', '', '' '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '' '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']

after fitting, the **predicted_decoder_output** gives output using Argmax on One Hot Representation as

['C', 'o', 'u', 'r', 'e', 'z', '\xe2', '\x80', '\xaf', '!', '\n', 'i', 'r', ' ', '?', '\n', 'i', 'l', '\xc3', '\xa9', ' ', '?', '\n', 'i', ' ', 'd', 'e', 'u', 's', ' ', 'c', 'o', 'u', 'r', 'e', '\xe2', '\x80', '\xaf', '!', '\n', '\n', '\n', ' ', '!', '\n', '\n', 'i', ' ', 'c', 'h', 'i', 'e', '\xe2', '\x80', '\xaf', '!', '\n', '\n', '\n', ' ', 'd', 'i', 'r', 'e'] 

keras_accuracy = 11/63

however, the relevant accuracy is = 11/11 as I don't need the model to consider accuracy for beyond the stop character.
Is there a way to get correct accuracy by ignoring the padded output ?

	SEQUENCE_LENGTH = 45
	MAX_SENTENCE_LENGTH = SEQUENCE_LENGTH - 3 # 1 for image, 1 for start token, 1 for end token
	OUTPUT_DIM = 512
	ANNOTATION_DIM = 512
	WORD_DIM = 512
	ANNOTATION_SIZE=196

	x_inp = Input(shape=(SEQUENCE_LENGTH-1, VOCAB_COUNT))
	z_inp = Input(shape=(ANNOTATION_SIZE, ANNOTATION_DIM,))
	z_mean = Input(shape=(ANNOTATION_DIM,))
	h_Dense = Dense(OUTPUT_DIM, input_dim=ANNOTATION_DIM, activation='softmax')(z_mean)
	c_Dense = Dense(OUTPUT_DIM, input_dim=ANNOTATION_DIM, activation='softmax')(z_mean)
	xt_dense = TimeDistributed(Dense(WORD_DIM))(x_inp)
	aLstm_Layer = AttentionLSTM(output_dim=WORD_DIM, z_dim=ANNOTATION_DIM, W_regularizer=l2(0.01), U_regularizer=l2(0.01), Z_regularizer=l2(0.01), dropout_W=0.3, dropout_U=0.3, dropout_Z=0.3, return_sequences=True)
	aLstm = aLstm_Layer([xt_dense, h_Dense, c_Dense, z_inp])
	tdense = TimeDistributed(Dense(VOCAB_COUNT))(aLstm)
	act = Activation('softmax')(tdense)
	model = Model(input=[x_inp, z_inp, z_mean], output=act)

	model.compile(optimizer='rmsprop', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
	model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=1, nb_epoch=1, verbose=1)

My attention has the following code in  function

	def step(self, x, states):
		prev_h1 = states[0]
		prev_c1 = states[1]
		proj_z = states[2]
		alphaz = states[3]
		B_U = states[4]
		B_W = states[5]
		B_Z = states[6]

		proj_state = K.dot(prev_h1, self.Wd_att)
		proj_z = proj_z + proj_state[:, None, :]
		proj_list = []
		proj_list.append(proj_z)
		proj_z = K.tanh(proj_z)

		alpha = K.dot(proj_z, self.U_att ) + self.b2_att
		alpha_shape = alpha.shape
		alpha = K.softmax(alpha.reshape((alpha_shape[0], alpha_shape[1])))

		alphaz = alpha
		self.alphaz = alpha

		z = (self.initial_z * alpha[:, :, None]).sum(1)
                #Remaing code same as LSTM.step()

To get the alpha value, I have defined the following function:
    alphaz = aLstm_Layer.states[3]
    alpha_func = K.function([x_inp, z_inp, z_mean], alphaz)
    al = alpha_func(x_train)
    print(al)

The above print statement always returns


I am setting alpha to zero in  and . 

Am I doing something wrong (with the model or the way I retrieve alpha) ? Is there a better way to get the value of  ? (I am doing this because I don't know if there's a way to make a layer give multiple outputs)

33,keras,3713,closed,Training slows down when using larger dataset,"Hi,

I am training a deep recurrent model on batches of a dataset at a time, by manually slicing the data and calling model.fit() on it. I noticed that when I use a larger dataset (same batch size, but more validation data), training slows down quite a bit, and monitoring CPU usage I can see that the process seems to be IO bound in some way (one core is constantly at 100%, and the other cores sporadically spike slightly, seemingly on minibatch start and end).

For reference, here is the some of the relevant part of my training code:



Just to clarify: 
- the model gets the same amount of training data in each  call, and that data is not a view but a copy of the relevant chunk of the big matrix)
- My systems RAM is far from being fully used
- I supply 2.5% of the whole dataset as validation data, so the amount of val data is higher if I use a larger dataset (note though that val testing does not seem to be what is slowing down training, as the CPU usage is poor during the epoch, not during testing)
- the larger the dataset, the more time one chunk takes to train. At 200k samples, it's around 240 seconds per  call, and at 2 million samples, it goes to around 1000 seconds.
- the time each epoch takes seems to be increasing with each call to 
- I've tried both RMSprop and SGD as optimizers, SGD seems to slow down less, but CPU usage is still bad on the large dataset

What could be slowing this down? If I drop the dataset size so that there are only around 2 chunks, CPU usage is basically perfect, and RAM does not seem to be the problem.

EDIT: the training time definitely appears to slow down with each epoch:


",stale,"['I may have worked out what it is: with more data, my vocabulary size also increases, and the model effectively trains more parameters in the Embedding layers.\n\nHowever, the issue of this causing poor CPU usage still bugs me a bit.

I was wondering if there is an example for an lstm layer that eventually feeds into a regression output layer. I am having a hard time putting one together.

I am hoping to feed in one sample at a time, where sample looks like this: 

input: [[x,x,x,x],[x,x,x,x],[[x,x,x,x],] output: [y]

This way, I would expect an lstm layer that takes in 4 inputs and after 3 iterations produces an output h to feed into a regression layer.

Cheers

One can find the code in the following link. [https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/imdb_lstm.py](url)

My problem is that as code progresses the training loss decreases and training accuracy increases as expected but validation accuracy fluctuates in an interval and validation loss increases to a high value. I attach a part of the log of the training phase below. Even I observe that when training loss is very small (~ 0.01-0.03) sometimes it increases in the next epoch and then it decreases again. What I mention can be seen in epochs 75-77. But in general it decreases. Is this behaviour expected at higher number of epochs? (I mean the fluctuations in the train_loss and train_acc.)

What I expect is that training accuracy always increases up to 0.99-1 and training loss always decreases. Moreover, the validation accuracy should start from maybe 0.4 and raise to for example 0.8 in the end. If validation accuracy does not improve over epochs what is the point of waiting during epochs? Also the test accuracy is close 0.81 at the end. I checked overfitting. But I could not come up with an explanation for fluctuations in val_acc with overfitting. What may be causing these fluctuations?

I also tried with my own data and came up with same situation. I processed my data in a similar way. I mean my training, validation and test points are processed in same logic as the ones in this example code.

Besides, I think the code takes the last output from LSTM for all time steps in a sample before feeding it to a dense layer.  What if I want to take the mean or max of all outputs for all time steps in LSTM layer before dense layer? How will I apply these operations in Keras? As far as I know return_sequence=True must be used. But how to combine outputs for all time steps in a sample to obtain a single representation of a sentence before dense layer?

Any help would be appreciated.

This would make the weighted loss be normalized. For instance, with N samples and weights w[i] with K non-zero weights, the weighted loss is sum(loss[i] * w[i] for i in range(N)) / K.

66,keras,3325,closed,Misclassification on small training set with pre-trained word vectors,"I am one of the many users having issues with passing the pre-trained embedding matrix to the Keras Embedding layer. My code currently looks like the following:



The first row of the pre-trained matrix  contains a random vector for the special token 'PAD'. This token is assigned the index 0 in the corpus and I assume that this index has special meaning in the lookup. The second row in this matrix contains a trained vector for the 'UNK' token which is returned whenever a word is not found in the vocabulary ('PAD' != 'UNK').

In the Embedding layer the input_dim is , which is the same number of rows in the  matrix. The output_dim is , which is the dimension of the word vectors. The input_length is  which is the (fixed) number of words in the padded sentences (padding with 0). The mask_zero argument is set to False because the matrix  already has a vector assigned in the first row for the 'PAD' token (index 0).

After running this on a very small training set of ~200 labeled sentences (3 labels) the accuracy is around 55% in both training and validation, but the prediction completely fails even on the training set. Almost all sentences therein are labeled the same.

So now it comes the questions:
1. Is it reasonable to use such a small training set to predict labels on sentences given a pre-trained word embeddnig matrix?
2. We have tried **not** passing the pre-trained embedding matrix and it produces the ""same"" results in terms of accuracy and predicted labels. How can we make sure this matrix is being used by the LSTM classifier?
3. Is it necessary to have a zero vector for the 'PAD' token or it can be random like we did?
4. We observe that the accuracy is highly correlated to the proportion of the labels in the training set. Do you think this information can help further debug the issue?
5. Could you add a complete example to the documentation with multiclass classification of sentences given word vectors? It seems that many people are struggling to get it working.

Please let me know if you need anything else in order to help with this issue.
",,"['Hi @juliohm, please find some of my thoughts on this:\n- Is it reasonable to use such a small training set to predict labels on sentences given a pre-trained word embeddnig matrix?\n  _Actually I expect pre-trained matrix will specially help when you have a smaller data set, as long as the language features in your classification problem are not so different from those used to train the embedding vectors._\n- We have tried not passing the pre-trained embedding matrix and it produces the ""same"" results in terms of accuracy and predicted labels. How can we make sure this matrix is being used by the LSTM classifier?\n  _Do you mean that you used an embedding layer without pre-trained matrix or without an embedding layer at all (e.g., by one-hot encoding)?_\n- Is it necessary to have a zero vector for the \'PAD\' token or it can be random like we did?\n  _To be frank I haven\'t totally figured out how this masking works. But usually using a zero vector for padding is a good idea because it essentially correspond to dropping out that part of sequence when you are using LSTM or 1d CNN._\n- We observe that the accuracy is highly correlated to the proportion of the labels in the training set. Do you think this information can help further debug the issue?\n  _There are many examples within Keras showing how to do multi classification with texts by using different models, e.g., with or without an embeddding, with an LSTM or 1D CNN and etc._\n- Could you add a complete example to the documentation with multiclass classification of sentences given word vectors?

That\'s what people usually do. And just make sure your sequences in train_X have word hashing index starting from 1 to voacb_size, with 0s as paddings._\n', ""Hi @dolaameng, thank you for taking the time. Continuing the discussion:\n1. I specifically asked about a training set with only ~200 labeled sentences. Is there any use case with such small number?\n2. I meant what I wrote: we kept the embedding layer, but didn't pass the pre-trained matrix.\n3. Apparently we have the same question. We both don't know how the mask works and the underlying conventions implemented in the library.\n4. I don't see the relation between what I asked and what you wrote.\n5. Why the example you linked doesn't mention LSTM?\n\nI hope that my questions are clearer now, I am still at the same page not knowing what is the cause of the issue.\n"", 'Hi @juliohm , \n1. whether 200 is too small or not depends on many other things, e.g., distribution of classes (is one of them dominating? ), avg seq len and etc. To be able to finger out which part of model is bringing down the performance, you need to benchmark it with at least a baseline (not necessarily from Keras), e.g., Naive Bayesian, Bag-of-words + MLP and etc. It\'s hard to tell if another use case is similar to yours just based on the # of sentences and # of classes. \n2. You can get the output from embedding layer and test if your weights are being used.\n3. Sorry I thought you were asking about the reason why people usually use zero vector to represent the padding and how a random vector would change the result. That\'s the part that I am not fully sure of. For the implementation in Keras, you can always refer to the source code.\n4. Simply saying ""accuracy is highly correlated to the proportion of the labels in the training set. "" won\'t reveal any further information, e.g., if 90% of your sentences are label 1 of course you can get 90% accuracy by just guessing everything is label 1. I was suggesting to use a baseline model to understand whether the problem is on your usage of embedding or other things. Again many Keras examples serve the educational purpose very well.\n5. I thought you were asking about ""multiclass classification of sentences given word vectors""?  LSTM is only one way of doing text classification. In fact, it is not even accepted as the best way compared to CNN when it comes to classifying the documents.\n\nIf your question is not directly related to identified bugs in Keras, I suggest you might want to post your thread to the user discussion group https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/keras-users for more answers.

Accuracy as a metric is assuming probabilities.\r\n\r\nIf you are trying to do classification, change the loss to crossentropy and the output activation to sigmoid/softmax (binary/categorical).

So which activation and loss function should i use for the out put?"", 'In that case ``linear`` and ``mean_square_error`` are both fine, ``accuracy`` is not a valid metric  in this case (not a classification problem). Consider using ``mean_square_error`` (the loss function) or ``mean_absolute_error`` as a metric.', ""So if I understood well the accuracy doesn't have any sens for my case.Then based on your experience from which value of mean_absolute_error I can say that I have efficient model with good prediction."", ""@cabiste007, I think you should have a look at what `mean_square_error` actual means and/or how it is computed. In its essence, MSE measures the average squared error of our predictions. For every prediction, the square difference between its prediction and its target value is computed. All squared differences are then averaged.  \r\n\r\nAn acceptable MSE value will be different for different datasets. We cannot quantify an 'optimal MSE score'. \r\nTo consider an MSE score to be 'good', you must consider the values you are predicting, as well as the distribution of the variables in your original dataset. \r\n\r\nAs an example, let's consider two mock datasets. I'll only compare these datasets, based on their variable ranges (or scale). Both datasets are well distributed.\r\n\r\n1)  First dataset has reasonable large values, such as car prices. Cars in this mock dataset are all somewhere in the range of 1000 to 80.000 usd. \r\nIf our model has an MSE of 50 we could say that the **average squared difference** between the estimate values and the predicted values is about 50.  \r\nOur model's performance is quite good, we will only predict values that are not that far off the truth.\r\n\r\n2) Second dataset has smaller values, such as lengths of persons (in cm). Our variables are all somewhere in the range of 120 to 250 cm. \r\nIf our second model as an MSE of 50 as well, we have to notice that this is quite a large error; as the possible range of our values is smaller, a MSE of 50 suddenly makes the average squared error for our predictions a lot further away from the truth than those in our first model. \r\n"", ""Adding to @RooieRakkert 's answer, there are two methods you can use to check how if your model is performing well for regression task:\r\n- If you're using `root_mean_squared` metric, make sure that training, validation, and testing error are low and close to each other in magnitude.\r\n- Use R^2 (coefficient of determination) metric from `sklearn` library. The best possible score is 1.0 and it can be negative (because the model can be arbitrarily worse). A constant model that always predicts the expected value of y, disregarding the input features, would get an R^2 score of 0.0. So you can check if your R^2 score is close to 1 then it's a good model."", '@briannemsick , @RooieRakkert and @dabasajay  I\'m so grateful thnak to you everything is clear in my mind right now.

I am using Keras LSTM on time series prediction (let time series is y[n]). Network input is time shifted vector y[0], y[-1], y[-2] etc.... After network training, I calculate one step prediction, then add prediction to input vector on first place and release last value. So i get prediction to e.g. 50 future points. Problem is, that predict method is very slow for this case. I noticed, that prediction time does change only a little with changing network size (for small networks - e.g.  1-50 LSTM cells). I know, that prediction of whole array of input of vectors is significantly faster, but that is not what i want. I tried to change Keras backend to CNTK or Theano, but it was worse than Tensorflow. 
Is there possibility to speed it up? What about of adding fast predict method for only one input vector? Would be there a way to use Tensorflow or CNTK directly without running through Keras?

Since the data I have at hand are for regression models as well, they do not fall under specific classes but only have different values. And as you said correctly, they are not quite evenly distributed(most larger than the rest). \r\nAccording to my understanding and attempts, I try to ""re-sample"" the data by using the smaller numbers more frequently in training. Nonetheless, the only difference is that the predicted number changes in value(just like the different mean values we obtain by applying different weights to data). I think the problem could be more likely within my model.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The current model I\'m using is composed fully of BLSTM layers (and of course a dense layer in the end). I referred to the excellent paper of Alex Graves(Framewise phoneme classification with bidirectional LSTM and other neural network architectures), so I also revised the last dense layer to be preceded by a TimeDistributed Dense layer and hence a Lambda layer to obtain the mean values that connected to the ultimate Dense(1) layer. However, there\'s no improvement at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Currently the simplification of the model shall be my major breakthroughs to be made here, but even with one single BLSTM of 8 units failed to give me sanguine outcomes. I\'m still working to figure out the reason that led me to the bottleneck!\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The activation I\'m using after each BLSTM layer is the rectified one(default).\r\nI did add a clipped ReLU after the final Dense layer to ensure the output does not exceed the range it is supposed to stay in. According to your nice suggestion, I removed it, but within the first few epochs I monitored, the predictions converge to the mean value even from Epoch 2, and hence this clipped ReLU is not working to confine the model at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo specify my model more clearly, I am using batch training. But because of the varied lengths of audio inputs, I padded zeros to the end of audios except the longest one in each batch. I\'m wondering if it is the zeros padded that cause such a mess.\r\n\r\nThank you so much again for your warm replies! They are all helpful and I\'m still working to implement them fully in depth. ', 'I had a similar issue, the problem on my end is I had too many neurons per layer, causing over-saturation of the model. I reduced the number of neurons by a large amount and that seemed to fix it on my end. ', 'Same problem here!\r\n\r\nI am training a small network and the training seems to go fine, the val loss decreases, I reach validation accuracy around 80, and it actually stops training once there is no more improvement (patience=10). It trained for 40 epochs. However, it keeps predicting only one class for every test image! \r\n\r\nI tried to initialize the conv layers randomly, I added regularizers, I switched from Adam to SGD, I added clipvalue, I added dropouts, I downsized the network. I also switched to softmax (I have only two labels but I saw some recommendation on using softmax and Dense layer with 2 neurons). Some or one of these helped with the overfitting, but nothing worked for the prediction problem.\r\n\r\n **The data is very balanced** (for training I have 32354 / 31681 for val I have 9092 / 9860 samples per class), so it doesn\'t make sense that it reaches 80% if it predicts the same labels for evaluation set as well.\r\n\r\nWhat is wrong with my model and how can I fix it? Is it the model, is it a bug or am I doing something wrong with predictions?

80,keras,11070,closed,Accuracy oscillates between ~0% and ~70% when creating new models,"Hi all,

**I've found that the problem doesn't occur when TensorFlow is forced to use the CPU** -- (I think) this implies that it's a TensorFlow bug and not a Keras bug, so maybe this issue can be closed.

First off, I'm using the Keras that's distributed with TensorFlow 1.10.0 so let me know if I should have opened the issue on their repo instead.

I'm using a sequence-to-sequence model based on the [Keras blogpost](https://blog.keras.io/a-ten-minute-introduction-to-sequence-to-sequence-learning-in-keras.html) which I've wrapped into a fairly complicated object (although the issue also occurs with a simplified version linked below). When I create a new model (which I have to do for gridsearch and for clearing the TF session when the graph gets too big and slows down training) it starts with accuracy of either 0% or 70%.

Here are a pair of screenshots that show what I mean:
 * Good: https://i.imgur.com/7mT5Siv.png
 * Bad: https://i.imgur.com/MZ3NdCB.png

You can see that in the first screenshot, the accuracy is low but trending upwards. In the second, the accuracy of two models starts at 70% and doesn't increase (another model starts at 3% and also doesn't increase).

This happens whether I create new, blank models or load pretrained weights into new models with .

85,keras,13136,closed,"Training accuracy increases, val accuracy stays the same","I am trying to train a CNN using frames that portray me shooting a ball through a basket. And my aim is for the network to be able to classify the result( hit or miss) correctly. When I train the network, the training accuracy increases slowly until it reaches 100%, while the validation accuracy remains around 65% (It is important to mention here that 65% is the percentage of shots that have a Miss label)   Does anyone have experience with a similar problem?
I am using PyTorch and Resnet18 ( have tried other architectures as well but they all gave the same result). My frames are jpg images of sie 224.

86,keras,12625,closed,Clearing GPU memory in Keras,"
80% my GPU memory get's full after loading pre-trained Xception model. but after deleting my model , memory doesn't get empty or flush.
I've also used codes like : K.clear_session() , gc.collect() , tf.reset_default_graph() , del model but none of them worked. Gpu properties say's 85% of memory is full. 

Nothing flush gpu memory except numba.cuda.close() but won't allow me to use my gpu again. The only way to clear it is restarting kernel and rerun my code.

I'm looking for any script code to add my code allow me to use my code in for loop and clear gpu in every loop.

Part of my code :

image_input = Input(shape=(224, 224, 3))
base_model = Xception(input_tensor=image_input, include_top=False,weights='imagenet')
base_model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',optimizer='adadelta',metrics=['accuracy'])

I test different optimizer,also improve epsilon value, set clipnorm(in optimizer above) and different loss functions('mean_squared_error', 'categorical_crossentropy') and so on, but failed.
#### Also in cpu or gpu mode, loss value is also nan.
# ##Even I switch to Convolution2D:


### The loss values remain nan
### Ways to solve?

So I'm wondering what's the real reason for the NaN loss value? How to solve or debug it?
Is the word2vec data wrong , padding method wrong or other?
If keras can't solve, I have to choose another deep learning package, or the reason is theano?
what can I do then? please help.

I'm addressing a sentence-level binary classification task. My data consists of 3 subarrays of tokens: left context, core, and right context.

I used Keras to devise several alternatives of Convolutional Neural Networks and validate which one best fit my problem.

I'm a newbie in Python and Keras and I decided to start with simpler solutions in order to test which changes improve my metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, f1 and auc-roc). The first simplification was regarding input data: I decided to ignore contexts to create a Sequential model of Keras:


As you can see, I use a fixed size of inputs so I applied a padding preprocessing. I also used an embedding layer with a Word2Vec model.

This model returns the following results:


I wished to implement how to select a subarray of input data inside my CNN by means of Lambda layers. I use the following definition of my Lambda layer:

Lambda(lambda x: x[:, 1], output_shape=(500,))(input)
And this is the summary of my new CNN (as you can see it's almost the same than the prior):


But the results were disgusting because accuracy stops at 60% and obviously, precision, recall and f1 were too low (< 0.10) regarding the first model results.

I don't know what's happening and I don't know if these networks are more different that I thought.

Any clue regarding this issue?

Is it normal that when i use a MLP to make a regression (with time series like sunspot) they are only 'loss' and 'val_loss' that decrease during the training ( acc and val_acc are always at 1.0000) ?

for information, I put a linear activation on output layer (which have only one neural) with mse and each hiden layer have 'relu' activation and dropout

Not sure if the issue is with tensorflow or with the way keras creates the tensorflow models, so I am cross-posting these issue to both repos.

## Setup


## Fitting



Here are some timings for the fit method:
* Tensorflow 1.4.1:  **2.91 s ﾂｱ 452 ms** per loop  (obtained using ipython's  magic, 7 loops)
* Tensorflow 1.5.0:  CPU times: user **2min 19s**, sys: 5min 22s, total: 7min 41s Wall time: 1min 2s

- TensorFlow backend (yes / no):  **yes**

**Current behavior**
During training,  shows very low scores.


**Expected behavior**  
After training, the model performs very well. The actual performance of the trained model on the task largely outclasses the suggested performance estimate during training.
Therefore I expect the metrics during training to show better values.

I am performing batch matrix multiplies of two tensors of size (batch, N, M) and (batch, M, K) to get a tensor of size (batch, N, K), with the matrix products. This behavior can be done with both tf.matmul and K.batch_dot with the default axis arguments.

However in K.batch_dot, the elementwise multiplication in the line https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/75a35032e194a2d065b0071a9e786adf6cee83ea/keras/backend/tensorflow_backend.py#L1248 eats up a lot of memory. The elementwise multiplication followed by summing over an axis is of course mathematically equivalent to the matrix multiply, but in the two-step implementation, Tensorflow assigns memory to the intermediate very large tensor.

In this simple example, my small GPU (Nvidia 970) is able to perform the calculation using tf.matmul, but using K.batch_dot Tensorflow fails with an OOM error.



This fails when it tries to assign a tensor of size (100, 10000, 500, 32) in the elementwise multiply in batch_dot (the dimension of 10000 not being strictly necessary in this case since we are only interested in the sum).",type:bug/performance,"['Thanks for reporting.

Your version of `# the last layer has return_sequences=False` might be not comparable to the original char-rnn?\n', '> 50 ""sentence"" batch size\n\nPlaying around with the batch size might allow you to get some speedup on GPU. Batch sizes that are too small mean that a lot of time will be spent moving minibatch data to and from the GPU memory.\n\n> Your version of # the last layer has return_sequences=False might be not comparable to the original char-rnn?\n\nSo how does char-rnn work exactly? I must say I\'ve never looked at it. In any case I would not expect much computational difference between `return_sequences=False` and `return_sequences=True` since in both cases the full sequence is being computed anyway. The computation steps are the exact same. \n', '@ffmpbgrnn regarding `return_sequences`, this could also be done with `True` for all layers and then using a non-zero index on the `predict()` result to get the last index. i don\'t think it\'s really changing anything, as @fchollet explains above.\n\nbut i think i understand what you\'re saying about the prediction being different. char-rnn samples one character at a time without resetting the state of the network. the keras lstm example, however, feeds in a `maxlen` sequence for every step, presumably resetting the state of the net before each prediction? meaning any relationships longer than `maxlen` will absolutely not be captured. (if `fit()` is also resetting the state of the network, this is a moot point.)\n\ni tried modifying the prediction process to see if anything happens:\n\n``` python\n        x = np.zeros((1, len(sentence), len(chars)))\n        for t, char in enumerate(sentence):\n            x[0, t, char_indices[char]] = 1.\n        preds = model.predict(x, verbose=0)[0]\n        next_index = sample(preds, diversity)\n        next_char = indices_char[next_index]\n        sys.stdout.write(next_char)\n\n        for iteration in range(400):\n            x = np.zeros((1, 1, len(chars)))\n            x[0, 0, next_index] = 1.\n\n            preds = model.predict(x, verbose=0)[0]\n            next_index = sample(preds, diversity)\n            next_char = indices_char[next_index]\n...\n```\n\nbut this just spits out complete gibberish. this makes me think the state is reset for every `predict()`.\n\nhere is the comparison of the loss curves:\n\n<img width=""604"" alt=""screen shot 2015-07-25 at 00 20 25"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/157106/8887863/2b852bb6-3263-11e5-94ef-78f8436de829.png"">\n\nkeras drops very low, and char-rnn bottoms out somewhere around epoch 20 (i don\'t have accuracy numbers for char-rnn).\n\nbut this graph doesn\'t seem to capture what\'s actually being learned. there\'s definitely something different that char-rnn is doing compared to the keras lstm example. after 20 epochs, char-rnn prints:\n\n```\n$ th sample.lua cv/lstm_19.00e_2x128_0.00d_50_1.4290l.t7 -temperature 1\nusing CUDA on GPU 0...  \ncreating an LSTM... \nmissing seed text, using uniform probability over first character   \n--------------------------  \ngod are questions has not already capable of the inner favourite confess or wither finders and delights--and HOPEOTOL, and then seeks he is always was even for his keens to have growt in all the science, all, in the soul of--home in so Asuated equalize, more ppodenus, that\nexistence, and are natured to forth and something of the lake\nreligious spoten of heaused by merit\nof the desire them--our ofteic plumsing expluaring heredatical, relicy also, and more\ndeceivative\nciriums, ""I purpfective excitable, it is note-side any greatred of reason\nwhen consequently\n```\n\netc.\n\nbut keras prints:\n\n```\n----- diversity: 1.0\n----- Generating with seed: ""o rich in futurity.

I'm fairly accustom to Keras and deep learning in general, but I've yet to use this ""bottleneck"" technique. I believe the problem is likely to be related to the corresponding of predicted output to informative labels, but I'm struggling to find a solution.

I'm facing an increase in validation loss when using multi_gpu_model to train a CNN. I kept the all other parameters constant (batchsize, learning rate).

This is how I implemented it:

 I created the single-gpu model:
  
      if num_gpus > 1:
        import tensorflow as tf
        with tf.device('/cpu:0'):

Then I converted it into a parallel model:

    if num_gpus > 1:
        parallel_model = multi_gpu_model(model, gpus=num_gpus)

Then I compile it and run the training:

    parallel_model.compile(...)
    parallel_model.fit_generator(...)

Any ideas what might be the source of error?

I'm using the latest Keras (current master) with the latest tensorflow (1.10.1).

Scenario Description 

Step #1:
I replaced the backbone in yoloV3 from Darknet53 to MobileNet. The MobileNet weights is loaded from the Imagenet, by using
.

Step #2:
I also want to load pre-trained weights for detector yolov3, so I download the .cfg and .weights files from the https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/ where we can find the file links as shown below in the original page.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YOLOv3-416 | COCO trainval | test-dev | 55.3 | 65.86 Bn | 35 | cfg | weights
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Obviously, the .weights and .cfg files for YOLOv3-416 include the weights for both yoloV3 detector, and its backbone, Darknet53.

Step #3 :
when we develop the new yolo body (yolo body = backbone + yolo Detector), by using, for example, 


where  ""weights_path"" is the place where we save the  .weights file in Step #2(Of course, the .cfg and .weights have been converted to .h5 file).

Now comes the issue: the new yolo body is composed of mobilenet + yoloV3, while the loaded pre-trained .h5 weights  is for Darknet53+yoloV3. How can we guarantee that we load the correct weights to the correct model, in this scenario, obviously, I just want to load the yoloV3 detector part to the new yolo body, and the Darknet53 weights in the .h5 file will be automatically dropped.

[This Keras blog][1] explains nicely, how a small dataset can be augmented by the following code:

    from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
    
    datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
            rotation_range=40,
            width_shift_range=0.2,
            height_shift_range=0.2,
            rescale=1./255,
            shear_range=0.2,
            zoom_range=0.2,
            horizontal_flip=True,
            fill_mode='nearest')

I am sure the vanilla example introduced in this blog works well, for similarly simple scenarios. 

In a much more complicated scenario, I want to use the weights of models pretrained on the famous [COCO dataset for object detection][2], to transfer learn new classes, for which I have only a very limited amount of data (<=1000).

The labeling granularity in such datasets is not per image, but per objects inside the images. I.e., each image may contain one or more objects which are marked by polygonical bounding boxes and these bounding boxes are labeled according to the object names they contain. This complex labeling information is encoded in json format, like in the following example:

Obviously, augmentation in this scenario is a bit more complicated, since  not only the images have to be distorted and rotated, but also the bounding boxes.   It would just make Keras so much more powerful and save users a lot of painstaking labeling work, if such a dataset could be augmented within a Keras pipeline.  And with the increasing relevance of Object Detection, this might be a feature to consider.

150,keras,11371,closed,Why weight restoring is not the default option in EarlyStopping?,"I was looking over the Keras documentation, when I noticed that the default for keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping is restore_best_weights=False.

In the documentation, the described behaviour is:
restore_best_weights: whether to restore model weights from the epoch with the best value of the monitored quantity. If False, the model weights obtained at the last step of training are used.

I find this a bit confusing because I think the principle of early stopping is to obtain the best results on the validation set by stopping the optimisation when the validation loss increases, which is the case without setting the patience parameter.

However, in early stopping it makes sense to set the patience parameter because you might get spurious overfittings due to momentary local optima. In that case, you would definitely want to restore the previous weights, because you might severely overfit after the end of your patience period.
Furthermore, I could not think of any reason why you would not want restore best weights in Early Stopping. The only case I can think of when you want to stop your training when there is no significant improvement on your loss, in order to reduce training time, but this is not the purpose of early stopping.
  
I'm wondering if there is any use case at all to make the False the default behaviour and if not, would not it make sense to change this?",type:support,"[""If you want to restore the weights that are giving the best performance, you have to keep tracks on them and thus have to store them.

I do see that you have to keep another model in memory, and this can be costly, but the model could have moved away a lot from the local optima in the patience period, meaning the model needs to be retrained from the beginning or from the last saved checkpoint, which is more costly. I think the default behaviour should be emphasised more in the documentation also when explaining the restore_best_weights, not only in the default function call, because it is very easy to look over this, due to the scrollbar.\r\n"", ""Maybe it's just the documentation that needs to be a bit clearer on this point."", ""I thought I'd have to do model checkpointing and early stopping - both - to be able to stop training early and save the model with the best performance. \r\n\r\nUntil I realised that you can just do early stopping with restore_best_weights changed to True.""]",[],[],0,0

154,keras,12879,closed,Get gradient of preprocessing without forward passing each time ,"I'm currently working on a regression problem where I need to preprocess the raw input data in a certain way (what's begin done is not relevant) before I can feed it to my neural network. I'm aware that preprocessing is usually done outside the model, but as I also need the gradients of the output of the network wrt. the raw input data (used in the loss function), I need the preprocessing to be included in the computational graph.

From what I've gathered, I need to feed the resulting tensor as input to the neural network in order for the two parts to be connected in the graph. An important note is that the preprocessing is done on the entire training set, meaning it only needs to be done once.

I've successfully implemented this using Keras backend functions, but the problem is that the preprocessing part seems to be performed at every forward pass of the model, which is both really unnecessary, and really slow. My hope was that the input tensor would be treated as some static (but differentiable) input to the network, with the forward-backward propagation simply flowing between the network input and output during training, but it doesn't seem to be working that way.

As my code is quite large and intricate, I'll leave a ""semi-pseudic"" code to simply show the gist of what I'm trying to do.



In the preprocessing function I have added a print-statement to the tensor that prints whenever the function is called, and it does indeed print at every epoch during training. This also happens even if I don't include the gradient in the loss function, showing that it most likely prints in the forward pass. The model does seem to train and predict as intended however, so the implementation seems to be correct.

There might be some flaws in my logic/understanding of how the graph works, and I'm hoping there is a simple fix to my problem.

To summarize:

1.  How do I feed a ""constant"", differentiable tensor as input to a neural network, without the tensor being calculated anew during each forward pass through the network?

As the preprocessed tensor contains all training samples, I would also like to split and train on smaller batches, so:

2.  Given there exists a solution to 1., how does batch-training tie into this? Do I have to create a generator and fit with fit_generator, or is it possible to let Keras handle it with fit?

Hope the problem was clear enough, and I'm grateful for all help/leads!

159,keras,2398,closed,Correct value for 'filter_length' for final layer(s) in Fully Convolutional Net,"Hi,

If we implement fully convolutional net in Keras, we want it to be able to work with input of arbitrary size.
In our case of 1D data - with arbitrary number of timesteps.

We can use None as an instruction that input could be of any size on the 1st dimension, e.g.:


But in the last layer(s) of  fully CN model we have to use actual length of the sequence as the filter_length in order to obtain sequence of labels correctly distributed along original timespan, e.g.:



As soon as we don't know actual sequence length before runtime, we have the following options:
1. Omit this parameter - but it's mandatory and it will not work
2. Use None value for the filter_length in order to tell Keras that this value will be available on runtime only (see input shape above) - it will cause an error (see output below)
3. Use some kind of placeholder value during network buildup and hope that it will be magically replaced by the real sequence length during runtime. We use this option and it looks like it works, but I wonder if it's correct and how other developers deal with this issue?

May be it's worth implementing filter_length = None as an option for arbitrary sequence?

160,keras,2608,closed,Zero-padding for ResNet shortcut connections when channel number increase,"Hello everybody,

I would like to implement the ResNet network with the shortcut connections that add zero entries when features/channels dimensions mismatch according to the original paper:

> When the dimensions increase (dotted line shortcuts
> in Fig. 3), we consider two options: (A) The shortcut still
> performs identity mapping, with extra zero entries padded
> for increasing dimensions ...
> http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385v1.pdf

However wasn't able to implement it and I can't seem to find an answer on the web or on the source code. All the implementations that I found use the 1x1 convolution trick for shortcut connections when dimensions mismatch.

The layer I would like to implement would basically concatenate the input tensor with a tensor with an all zeros tensor to compensate for the dimension mismatch.

The idea would be something like this, but I could not get it working:



Does anyone has an idea on how to implement such a layer ?

Thanks a lot

I follow the example ""Fine-tune InceptionV3 on a new set of classes"" on [this page][1].

So I first trained the top dense layers that were added to the InceptionV3 base model with the following code:

    model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

    for layer in base_model.layers:
        layer.trainable = False

    parallel_model = multi_gpu_model(model, gpus=2)
    
    parallel_model.compile(optimizer='rmsprop', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
    
    history = parallel_model.fit_generator(generate_batches(path), steps_per_epoch = num_images/batch_size, epochs = num_epochs)

After that, I try to fine-tune the top 2 inception blocks from InceptionV3. And according to the example, what I should do is:

    for layer in model.layers[:249]:
       layer.trainable = False
    for layer in model.layers[249:]:
       layer.trainable = True
    
    model.compile(optimizer=SGD(lr=0.0001, momentum=0.9), loss='categorical_crossentropy')

    model.fit_generator(...)

But I'm using the , so I don't know how to freeze the first 249 layers. 

I mean, if I freeze the layers in the no-gpu model (like the example), and use  to freeze the layers in the , then the weights in the top dense layers that were just trained and contained in the  will be overwritten, right?

On the other hand, I tried to directly use , but when I checked the layers in the , it showed:

    for i, layer in enumerate(parallel_model.layers):

    (3, 'model_1')
    (4, 'dense_3')

So what are the 'lambda_1', 'lambda_2' and 'model_1' layers and why it only shows 5 layers in the ?

This means if you freeze `K` parameters in SM, you will also see `K` non-trainable parameters in PM.  \r\n\r\nMore specific, if you do something below\r\n```\r\nsingle_model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)\r\n\r\n# freeze/unfreeze weights in SM\r\nfor layer in single_model.layers:\r\n    layer.trainable = False\r\n\r\nparallel_model = multi_gpu_model(single_model, gpus=2)\r\nparallel_model.compile(optimizer='rmsprop', loss='categorical_crossentropy')\r\n\r\nprint single_model.summary()\r\nprint parallel_model.summary()\r\n```\r\nyou will see both print out messages show the same number of non-trainable parameters.\r\n\r\nOnce again, you should only freeze `a layer` when it is a `keras layer` (just as SM in this case, it is actually `model`)\r\n"", 'This is correct. You can set `trainable` on layers from the original `model`, and that will be taken into account in `parallel_model`. \r\n\r\nHowever, you should always remember to `compile` `parallel_model` after changing any trainable value. Compiling is required for any changes to be taken into account.', ""Thanks, but let me make sure I understand correctly.\r\n\r\nLet's say, I first freeze some layers in the original `model`, then call `parallel_model = multi_gpu_model(model, gpus=2)`, `parallel_model.compile(...)` and `parallel_model.fit(...)`. I understand this because the statement `parallel_model = multi_gpu_model(model, gpus=2)` will copy the `trainable` setting from the original `model` to the `parallel_model`.\r\n\r\nBut after that, I want to freeze other layers in the `parallel_model`. So this time, I only need to set trainable on layers from the original `model` and compile the `parallel_model`, and I do NOT need to call `parallel_model = multi_gpu_model(model, gpus=2)` to freeze the layers in the `parallel_model`, is that correct?\r\n\r\nIf so, how is the `trainable` setting transferred from the original `model` to the `parallel_model` in this case?"", 'Yes, that\'s correct.

185,keras,100,closed,Roadmap,"Here are the key features that we will have in Keras by the time it hits v1.0. 
- Visualization tools, possibly built on top of Bokeh. You should be able to see everything that's going on in your experiment, and maybe even manage your experiments from a GUI. Total visualization is key to doing good research.
- Easy support for Spearmint for hyperparameter search.
- Complete unit tests. The recent regularizers/constraints debacle that left Kaggle users confused highlights once more that reliable unit tests should be an absolute priority. We want to be able to develop quality code safely and with confidence. 
- Better convnet features, including FFT convolutions, and maybe new padding options. In the medium term we should look into incorporating support for Nervana Systems' fast convolution kernels. Let's stay state of the art ;-)
- Support for non-sequential models, by the way of:
  - [DONE] a Merge container that takes a list of Sequential models and turns them into a single output
  - a Fork container that replicates the output of a Sequential model to a list of Sequential models
    (both would be trainable end-to-end, of course).

",Enhancement stat:contributions welcome,"[""Sounds Great! \n\nYou have provided a high level direction. \nCouple of (minor) things I would add to the list:\n1.

Having a Model Zoo with various models trained on a wide number of Datasets would be great. \n\nMy thoughts on your ideas:\n1. GUI is a must as you have stated. I'm currently running a basic graphing and filter visualization code with keras + matplotlib , but thats very basic and a more robust approach is needed. Nvidia's DIGITS Library would give some good inspiration. It's runs on a local server,  Bokeh would give us that,  but its dependencies are enormous. But,  it's a really versatile library that can support all ranges of work done on keras. \n2. Adding native t-SNE somewhere in the loop would be a great addition. \n3. Building a better abstracted Layer Class would help both now and the future demands. Recently there was minor issue with having Dropout Layer as the 1st layer. If there is a chance to improve this,  it would be now. Once the core Layer Class is fixed and shipped, changing that will break a lot of things and create a lot of hassle.  So I would suggest a through debate on the core layer class,  so any future layers -  be it fork,  merge or whatever, that can be built.  \n"", ""> Interfacing with Caffe Models - loading, saving weights.\n\nDefinitely something that would be great to have.

190,keras,6580,closed,Note about the categorical_crossentropy?,"Hi,

I'm not sure but the documentation about categorical_crossentropy seems to be not compatible with the tensorflow one.

I mean just had a look at the documentation about loss functions i. e.
https://keras.io/losses/#available-loss-functions

and at the end there is a note about the categorical_crossentropy.
There is such a sentence:

""Note: when using the categorical_crossentropy loss, your targets should be in categorical format (e.g. if you have 10 classes, the target for each sample should be a 10-dimensional vector that is all-zeros expect for a 1 at the index corresponding to the class of the sample).""

So I understand that the only possible target is e.g. [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]?

But in the tensorflow documentation about softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits  we have (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits)

""While the classes are mutually exclusive, their probabilities need not be. All that is required is that each row of labels is a valid probability distribution.""

which I understand means that such a target is possible [0.0, 0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0]?

categorical_crossentropy is defined in https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.1/tensorflow/contrib/keras/python/keras/backend.py and indeed returns softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits.

Am I missing something (if yes then I'm really sorry)?

Best wishes

201,keras,3809,closed,How does fit_generator works,"I'm not quite understand how fit_generator works. In particular what does mean parameter samples_per_epoch? As described [here](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/1627) samples_per_epoch = batch_size \* numbers of batches and fit_generator will read exactly samples_per_epoch samples from generator. And there also said that we control batch size by our generator yieldings. But here begins what I'm really missing.

Let's assume that generator return batch of 5 single samples and we want to train model on 10 batches per epoch so we have training on 50 single samples per epoch. But if we set samples_per_epochs with given formula we get 50 samples taken by fit_generator and each sample is a BATCH yielded by generator so we get 5*50=250 single samples.  I see that we can get samples number in a batch by dividing input length by length of input shape's zero axis. Therefore we can calculate how much times we need to ask for a batch. But it seems too intricately for me.

Ok. Then let's suppose that the formula is wrong and in this case we set samples_per_epoch to our batch_size. It looks more confident for me. Then generator will take exactly sample_per_epoch batches from generator. Again batch size in units of single samples can be computed by dividing.

So the question is what is actually right?

205,keras,3310,closed,DisconnectedInputError: When Popping Layers and Adding on Top,"Currently I'm trying to use multiple vgg16 models from the keras model zoo to classify videos.
At this stage I'm taking only a few frames from each video to classify the whole video.
What I do is I take a VGG model, popout the last two layers and merge a few of these models togethers.

But this method isn't working right now, when I try to train the network. I get an error from Theano about disconnected inputs, These inputs are apparently the inputs that I popped off the vgg model. So I think that might be the problem.  Also I don't get this error if I don't load the weights for the vgg model.

I've been attempting to implement the EntropySGD in this paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01838.pdf). However the inner loop of the optimizer requires L gradient updates to estimate the exponential decayed mus which are used to update the parameters on one batch of data. It looks like  'get_updates' is called from training.py. My question is:

1. Is there a way to update the network params, compute a new loss and get new gradients on the same batch of data in the optimizer class to run the L iterations for the Langevin dynamics?

First of all thanks for this wonderful framework and great work you guys have done.

I have been trying to use Keras to build a simple LSTM language model with a vocabulary of size 50,000. Considering one-hot representation of words, this translates into 50,000 classes. 
To avoid padding, I have been dividing my training data (~80 million sentences) into chunks where each chunk includes sentences of the same length. Model compiles well and training loss is decreasing but I have two main problems:

1) Using ""  "" function results in huge memory (and computation?) waste. I tried """" to avoid it but got a rank mismatch error from Theano. Is there any work around for this? 

2) I guess when the number of classes is huge the running time becomes very high. Is there any solution for this?
E.g., in my language model experiment, with just one LSTM layer and a Softmax layer on the top, 512 cells for LSTM, maximum sentence length of 15, vocabulary size 50,000 and mini-batch size = 1024 sentences, it takes 4 sec / mini-batch on GPU, which is too long.

220,keras,7927,closed,CNN to manage sequences of grayscale images like a video files,"Hello,

I'm in trouble because I'm not able to manage correctly the CNN and maybe the LSTM-RNN. 

I'm trying to solve the following problem. I've 20000 chunks of data that each of them are composed by a sequence of 20 images. The size of each image is 40x40. The images are in grayscale mode. For each chunk of data, we have two possible labels, 0 or 1. We have to classify each chunk of data in two possible sets: 0 or 1. As they are numpy arrays, the shape of each one is:
- Data shape: (20000, 20, 40, 40)
- Labels shape: (20000, 1)

Well, I want to train a CNN to predict if the label of a chunk of data is 0 or 1. Remember that each chunk of data is composed by 20 images of 40x40 in grayscale. And the most important thing is that the order of that 20 images matter. I mean, they have to be managed as a 'little' video file of 20 images. If we change the order of that 20 images in a chunk of data the label should be different.

I don't know if is mandatory to use a RNN. I've read some papers where the researchers have used CNN without LSTM and with LSTM for trying to solve similar problems. I think that it isn't mandatory but I think that I've to use the combination of CNN with TimeDistributed. Am I right?

Thank you so much in advance.

Kind regards,

",,"[""I don't think this question should be a Keras Issue, as it has nothing to do with the development of Keras as a library.\r\n\r\nThat said, I think convolutional LSTM (which exists in Keras, although I am not sure about the implementation, see this Issue https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/7918). It works like a normal convolutional layer, allowing it to effectively learn spatiotemporal things. You can also use 3D convolutions, which answers the question of if it is mandatory to use an RNN (it is not), but RNNs are designed to model the learning of long temporal sequences, which sound like what you're describing. A common implementation is to first work with convolutional layers (that work frame-by-frame, using TimeDistributed) and then once you've scaled the spatial dimensions down to something very small, use a TimeDistributed Flatten layer, followed by a normal (non-spatial) LSTM. I think this way of thinking is a bit flawed, but depending on the data it might work well. This way of modelling assumes that you can get a compact representation of the video frames for each frame independently, and then see the sequence of that compact data and draw temporal conclusions from that.

227,keras,4962,closed,How to add Attention on top of a Recurrent Layer (Text Classification),"I am doing text classification. Also I am using my pre-trained word embeddings and i have a  layer on top with a  at the end.

Pretty simple. Now I want to add attention to the model,  but i don't know how to do it.
 
My understanding is that i have to set  so as the attention layer will weigh each timestep accordingly. This way the LSTM will return a 3D Tensor, right?
After that what do i have to do?
Is there a way to easily implement a model with attention using Keras Layers or do i have to write my own custom layer?

If this can be done with the available Keras Layers, I would really appreciate an example.
",,"[""It's been a while since I've used attention, so take this with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\n`return_sequences` does not necessarily need to be `True` for attention to work; the underlying computation is the same, and this flag should be used only based on whether you need 1 output or an output for each timestep.\r\n\r\nAs for implementing attention in Keras.. There are two possible methods: a) add a hidden `Activation` layer for the softmax or b) change the recurrent unit to have a softmax.\r\n\r\nOn option a): this would apply attention to the output of the recurrent unit but *not* to the output/input passed to the next time step. I don't this is what is desired. In this case, the LSTM should have a squashing function applied, as LSTMs don't do too well with linear/relu style activation.\r\n\r\nOn option b): this would apply attention to the output of the recurrentcy, and also to the output/input passed to the next timestep. I *think* that this is what is desired, but I could be wrong. In this case, the linear output of the neurons would be squashed directly by the softmax; if you wish to apply a pre-squashing such as `sigmoid` or `tanh` before the softmax calculation, you would need a custom activation that does both in one step.\r\n\r\nI could draw a diagram if necessary, and I should probably read the activation papers again.."", ""@patyork Thanks for the reply. \r\nDo you have a good paper (or papers) in mind (for attention)?

I admit I don\'t often look at the google group, but that is a valid place to ask these questions, as well as on the Slack channel.\r\n\r\n[Bengio et. al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044v3.pdf) has a pretty good paper on attention (soft attention is the softmax attention).\r\n\r\nAn example of method a) I described:\r\n```python\r\nvocab_size = embeddings.shape[0]\r\nembedding_size = embeddings.shape[1]\r\n\r\nmodel = Sequential()\r\n\r\nmodel.add(Embedding(\r\n        input_dim=vocab_size,\r\n        output_dim=embedding_size,\r\n        input_length=max_length,\r\n        trainable=False,\r\n        mask_zero=True,\r\n        weights=[embeddings]\r\n    ))\r\n\r\nmodel.add(LSTM(200, return_sequences=False))\r\nmodel.add(Activation(\'softmax\')) #this guy here\r\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.5))\r\n\r\nmodel.add(Dense(3, activation=\'softmax\', activity_regularizer=activity_l2(0.0001)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nexample b), with simple activation:\r\n```python\r\nvocab_size = embeddings.shape[0]\r\nembedding_size = embeddings.shape[1]\r\n\r\nmodel = Sequential()\r\n\r\nmodel.add(Embedding(\r\n        input_dim=vocab_size,\r\n        output_dim=embedding_size,\r\n        input_length=max_length,\r\n        trainable=False,\r\n        mask_zero=True,\r\n        weights=[embeddings]\r\n    ))\r\n\r\nmodel.add(LSTM(200, return_sequences=False, activation=\'softmax\'))\r\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.5))\r\n\r\nmodel.add(Dense(3, activation=\'softmax\', activity_regularizer=activity_l2(0.0001)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nexample b) with sigmoid and then softmax (non-working, but the idea):\r\n```python\r\nvocab_size = embeddings.shape[0]\r\nembedding_size = embeddings.shape[1]\r\n\r\ndef myAct(out):\r\n    return K.softmax(K.tanh(out))\r\n\r\nmodel = Sequential()\r\n\r\nmodel.add(Embedding(\r\n        input_dim=vocab_size,\r\n        output_dim=embedding_size,\r\n        input_length=max_length,\r\n        trainable=False,\r\n        mask_zero=True,\r\n        weights=[embeddings]\r\n    ))\r\n\r\nmodel.add(LSTM(200, return_sequences=False, activation=myAct))\r\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.5))\r\n\r\nmodel.add(Dense(3, activation=\'softmax\', activity_regularizer=activity_l2(0.0001)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, I should say that my notes about whether a) or b) above is what you probably need are based on your example, where you want one output (making option b probably the correct way). Attention is often used in spaces like caption generation where there is more than 1 output such as setting `return_sequences=True`. For those cases, I think that option a) is the described usage, such that the recurrency keeps all the information passing forward, and it\'s just the higher layers that utilize the attention.', '@patyork Thanks for the examples and for the paper. I new that posting here would get more attention :P \r\n\r\nI will try them and post back.', ""@patyork, I'm sorry, but I don't see how this implements attention at all?\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding, the softmax in the Bengio et al. paper is not applied over the LSTM output, but over the output of an attention model, which is calculated from the LSTM's hidden state at a given timestep. The output of the softmax is then used to modify the LSTM's internal state. Essentially, attention is something that happens *within an LSTM* since it is both based on and modifies its internal states.\r\n\r\nI actually made my own attempt to create an attentional LSTM in Keras, based on the very same paper you cited, which I've shared here:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/mbollmann/ccc735366221e4dba9f89d2aab86da1e\r\n\r\nThere are several different ways to incorporate attention into an LSTM, and I won't claim 100% correctness of my implementation (though I'd appreciate any hints if something seems terribly wrong!), but I'd be surprised if it was as simple as adding a softmax activation."", '@mbollmann You are correct that none of the solutions @patyork is what i want. i want to get a weight distribution (importance) for the outputs from each timestep of the RNN.

', '@mbollmann Please do if you can. \r\nI am trying to implement it right now and trying to understand the Keras API.\r\n\r\nI don\'t have a working solution but i think i should set  `return_sequences=True` in the RNN in order to get the intermediate outputs and `masking=False`.\r\nOn top of that i am thinking  i should put a `TimeDistributed(Dense(1))`  with a softmax activation. But i haven\'t figured out how to put everything together.\r\n\r\nAlso i think that putting `masking=False` won\'t affect the performance as the attention layer will assign the correct weights on the padded words.

The above illustration uses a bidirectional recurrent network, but that窶冱 not important and you can just ignore the inverse direction. _The important part is that each decoder output word y_t now depends on a weighted combination of all the input states, not just the last state._ The a窶s are weights that define in how much of each input state should be considered for each output. So, if a_{3,2} is a large number, this would mean that the decoder pays a lot of attention to the second state in the source sentence while producing the third word of the target sentence. The a's are typically normalized to sum to 1 (so they are a distribution over the input states).\r\n\r\nWhat different kind of attention do you have in mind? In the article attention is described in the context of machine translation. In my case (classification) i just want a better representation for the sentence."", 'Yeah, after thinking about this, it makes sense. The softmax multiplication will weight the timestep outputs (most will be near zero, some nearer to 1) and the so the sum of those will be close to the outputs of the ""near to 1"" timesteps - pretty clever.\r\n\r\nIn this case, `axis=-2` is equivalent to `axis=1`; I use the reverse indexing all the time, so that I never have to remember that Keras includes the batch_size (the `None` aspect) in those shapes. [You ran into this gotcha earlier](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/4962#issuecomment-271710714); using the reverse indexing means I never have to think about that aspect - and you\'ll see that form of indexing throughout the actual Keras code for this reason.\r\n\r\nI just mean that implementation seems a little limiting - you have to set `T=50` or another limit; it can\'t be an infinite or undefined variable, which means you have to throw away the first `T-1` (49) outputs/training outputs. As that image leads me to believe, the T should be infinite/undefined/variable, Something like the `TimeDistributed` wrapper *could* provide. Perhaps this is a good thing, perhaps not - I haven\'t tried both ways (obviously).', 'Phew, a lot happened here, and I think I agree with most of what was written.  Using `Dense(1)` without the TimeDistributed wrapper was what I was already trying to argue for yesterday, some dozens posts above, so that does seem correct to me as well in this scenario.', '@mbollmann I read that - it seems like you talked yourself out of that at some point though, based on the edit. I was confusing/arguing with myself to no end throughout this entire issue as well.\r\n\r\nI learned quite a bit though, at least.', ""@patyork @mbollmann Thank you both! I learned a lot.\r\n\r\nBtw after runnng some tests, i am not impressed. I see no obvious improvement compared to the classic senario (using just the last timestep). But the idea is interesting...\r\n\r\n@patyork This may be stupid, but what do you mean by saying:\r\n> it can't be an infinite or undefined variable, which means you have to throw away the first T-1 (49) outputs/training outputs.\r\n\r\nWhy are they thrown? They are used in the weighted sum, aren't they? *\r\nI agree that this is limiting as it won't work with masking (series of varying length).\r\n\r\n*Do you mean the timesteps that are padded to keep a constant length?"", 'Sorry - hard concept to explain in words, so:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1304633/21860920/a6c62232-d7e7-11e6-9d5d-a8ef91d536b8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSay you have a sequence of 8 items; you want to apply attention with a lookback of 3; by default, you have to feed the first 3 items to get the first output, so you wind up with `length - T + 1` or `8-3+1=6` possible outputs (the blue arrows). Looking at the diagram, there would generally be 8 outputs/targets available, but 2 were dropped (the red arrows).\r\n\r\nThinking some more, I\'ve just realized the solution: add `T-1` padding inputs at the beginning, like so:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1304633/21861078/2f96d9ee-d7e8-11e6-9083-f7361751b83e.png)\r\n..so you\'ve now got the first output (dependent on the masked/padding input and the first input) and the second output (dependent on one pad, the first, and the second inputs) as they should be.\r\n\r\nThe only rub here is how to implement it: I don;t think the Lambda nor Flatten layers support masking, so those padding inputs would need to be ""neutral"" data as they can;t be masked out easily.\r\n\r\nHope that makes sense.\r\n\r\nEdit: to make clear: the colored boxes in the diagrams are the window of T items that produce an output. There are 6 boxes (8-3+1) in the first diagram which seems like you have to drop 2 (T-1) of the outputs. The second diagram has all 8 boxes/outputs with padding leading in.', 'If i understand correctly what you are saying, this applies only in the case of stateful RNNs.\r\nI see the problem and i haven\'t thought about it.

I am also trying to implement attention. It is mostly same with @mbollmann but with different H matrix. Hope it will work. I will ask questions if I get stuck. ', ""Coming back to it... is there a way to make it work with masking?\r\nThe main problem is that the `attention = Dense(1, activation='tanh')(activations)` layer computes weights for every timestep even for the zero-padded and this results in _a lot_ of wasted time. Most of the times the length of the input series is around 10 but it can go as long as 70. So i have increased max_length in order to cover these long inputs.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to make it work using the existing layers, or with a simple workaround or this can only be done by implementing a custom Layer for attention?"", ""@baiziotis It should work with masking like every other layer, i.e. calculate everything, then apply the mask by multiplication, setting the masked timesteps to zero. I'm not sure what the alternative would be -- computations are usually performed in batches via matrix multiplication, which kind of requires padding to make all samples have the same shape. Or am I misunderstanding something?"", ""There are (were, as of a month ago) several layers that don't support Masking. I think Repeat Vector and Flatten were among those that don't support it.\r\n\r\nEven if Masking was supported, it would still calculate the N=70 timesteps each batch (even all of the 0's).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly what your code is looking like now, but Recurrent networks allow you to pass any length sequence at any time; in keras, I think you have to set the input shape to (None, ...) instead of (70, ...) and you'll be able to feed it a batch with any length of timesteps. Then you can create a random batch, and then pad (or if it works, mask) the samples in the batch up to the length of the longest sequence in the batch, which is probably <70 long.\r\n\r\nex:\r\n```\r\nlen(batch[0]) = 14\r\nlen(batch[1]) = 21\r\nlen(batch[2]) = 10\r\n\r\nbatch[0] -> pad to length 21\r\nbatch[1] -> no padding needed\r\nbatch[2] -> pad to length 21\r\n```"", ""Sorry for the late reply... To be more specific, my problem is text (sentence) classification. The length of the sentences in my dataset follow a normal distribution and i have set the `max_length` to the length of the longest sentence. But this results in a lot of wasted computations as most of the sentences have around 20-30 words. \r\n\r\n@mbollmann  i though that what masking was doing was restricting the RNN from processing the padded timesteps. My problem was not about the performance but the efficiency of the model. The masked timesteps won't matter in the weighted sum (attention) anyway.\r\n\r\n@patyork You are correct that the problem with masking has to do with the `Flatten`, `Permute`, `Repeat` layers. \r\nAs you can see form all the code chunks that i have posted above, i nowhere explicitly define the input shape to the RNN. The problem begins with the embedding layer where i have to fill the `input_length` param.\r\n```python\r\n_embedding = Embedding(\r\n        input_dim=vocab_size,\r\n        output_dim=embedding_size,\r\n        input_length=max_length,\r\n        trainable=trainable,\r\n        mask_zero=masking,\r\n        weights=[embeddings]\r\n    )\r\n```\r\nBut as soon as i set masking to True i get an error that Flatten does not support masking. \r\nAlso i don't understand what input shape i have to set to `None`.

This argument is required if you are going to connect  Flatten then Dense layers upstream (without it, the shape of the dense outputs cannot be computed).\r\n\r\nTheoretically, since it's an LSTM that follows, perhaps input_length could be None? This layer would generally output a shape (None, 70, embedding_size), but (None, None, embedding_size) is a valid shape for an LSTM to take I think.

Discussion about a dense prediction API such as image segmentation in https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/6538 brought up the possibility of a functional preprocessing API, which could move preprocessing steps into the Keras backend APIs and generalize preprocessing to more network designs. [Dropout](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/layers/core.py#L72) provides a precedent for such augmentation layers.

If the layers could be designed much like dropout, and I would expect them to be configured so that the augmentation operations could be applied identically to one or more image inputs as well as one or more image label data, useful for dense prediction tasks.

This could have the advantages of being easy to use, easily applied consistently for arbitrary data inputs, and make it possible to use the [TF backend image augmentation APIs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/image) thus improving performance.

What would be the pros/cons and barriers to a Functional Preprocessing API?


Example usage, label augmentation optional for dense prediction tasks:

Hello, I am using Faster-RCNN with ResNet50 as base network for object detection. It uses a custom BatchNormalization layer named 'FixedBatchNormalization' in ResNet. I want to know what's the difference between this custom layer and the official BatchNormalization layer in keras. I know that there is an ongoing issue with fine-tuning ResNet when freezing layers. So does the 'FixedBatchNormalization' in this repo solve that issue and does this anyway affect the training and evaluating?

And this layer works only with keras version 2.1.6.

but I am seeing a mean loss around 1, which is the standard deviation of my randomly generated data, so the model does not seem to learn.

Am I having something wrong?",,"[""All LSTMs are stateful. Keras `stateful` only means stateful between batches.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that gradient can't backprop between batches. So you are using state t at time t+1, but those are two separate batches and gradient can't flow back to the hidden representation at t.\r\n\r\nAn LSTM can only learn dependencies effectively within a batch. Stateful can hypothetically learn something between batches but don't depend on it. Batch t+1 will do the best it can do based on hidden t, but hidden t will not try to make a good representation.\r\n\r\nIf you modify your code to make batches of 2 instead of 1, it should start working.\r\n\r\nCheers"", 'Thanks Ben for this answer. Please bear with me on this example and correct my misunderstandings.\r\n\r\n1- I tried with a `batch_size = 2`, and even with a `batch_size = 20` and got the same result. Basically the model is not learning anything.\r\n\r\n2- My understanding is that whatever batch_size I put, I will not see that y(t) depends on x(t-1). Indeed, as in every batch, I am giving the pairs (x(t), y(t)), back propagation through time will only compute the derivative of the loss with respect to x(t). The batch size is there only to estimate that derivative on a large number of samples, then take the mean. So whatever batch_size I put, I will not see the dependence on x(t-1). The only way I can see it is to put nb_steps (the length of the window of x sequence) to a number greater than 1).\r\n\r\nSo the LSTM does not learn dependcies within a batch : every row of the batch is treated independently, and the longer the batch, the better is the derivative estimates. Dependencies seem learned within the window of xs given to the model (nb_steps in keras nomenclature, i.e. the second parameter in batch_input_shape = (..., ..., ...).\r\n\r\nWhat I hoped with my experiment was that the network will learn to simply put the input x[t] in its hidden state, then at t+1, return its hidden state as output y[t+1], and replaces the hidden state by x[t+1], and do like that recursively. Obviously, I can achieve this by using a stateless LSTM with nb_steps = 2 or larger, but wanted to have the result with a stateful one.\r\n\r\nIf I am right, it seems the LSTM or other recurrent neural network is able to learn a history as long as the input sequence (nb_steps in keras nomenclature). So if I am dealing with time series where y(t) depends on x(t-101) and it happens that the moving window of xs that I use as input to the model is of length 100 only, then the model will not learn anything.\r\n\r\nPlease correct me', ""Yup. I meant batches with depth 2 instead of 1. Just realized how vague I was.\r\n\r\nBackprop of an lstm is only within the batch and goes back the depth of the batch. If your depth is more than 1 it should work.\r\n\r\nWith depth one, the top level can be trained, but it won't backprop to the previous layers."", 'Coming back to the example of volvador:\r\n\r\n> So if I am dealing with time series where y(t) depends on x(t-101) and the batch-depth (seq. length) is 100\r\n\r\nIn this case the function will not be able to learn our example, right? \r\n\r\nSo `stateful=True` will just give me a light version of recurrence?', 'If your sequence length is 100 and the only dependency is 101 away, then then function will not learn that dependency.\r\n\r\nIf there is also another dependency 100 away, the model will learn to encode that dependency into the hidden state. If you run a stateful LSTM, the model will try to predict 101 from the hidden state at 100, which might still have some useful information.\r\n\r\nThe thing to keep in mind is that information travels through backprop, which is only working within a single batch.\r\n\r\nAlso, keep in mind these are largely hypothetical and an LSTM is probably not going to learn much with a depth of 100. It gets harder and harder to learn longer dependencies. LSTM will learn longer dependencies than simple RNNs but not infinite. You could read into highway networks or multi-timescale learning if 100 was not just a figure of speech.\r\n\r\nCheers', ""Thanks a lot, that makes it more understandable.\r\n\r\nMy dependencies are actually not that long (though not actually known), I just have the problem that my dimensionality is large and using a sliding window approach would significantly increase training time. I thought with a stateful RNN I could circumvent giving overlapping slices after slices to the network. Turns out I can't."", ""No free lunch.

Do you mean ""one sample in a batch"" when you say ""batch"" here.\r\n ""Backprop of an lstm is only within the batch and goes back the depth of the batch. If your depth is more than 1 it should work"". \r\n\r\nAs per my understanding BPTT is only done for an individual sample within a batch, rather than over the entire batch.  Each sample is formed by concatenating _l_ consecutive time steps together. Thus _l_ decides the length of BPTT.  And there is no way to backprop over different samples or preserve state from one sample to another in a batch. Am I correct?\r\n\r\nThanks ', ""Don't get too hung up on the language. In audio processing there are many samples per sequence. In text processing a sample is a sequence.\r\n\r\nI like to think of a batch as being made of samples. Each sample is independent and the independent gradients for samples are combined. If you backprop between samples, you kind of only have one sample.\r\n\r\nThen again, if you use something like batchnorm, there is a gradient between sample 0 at time 0 and sample `n` at time `t`. So maybe we should think of those samples as part of a meta-sample, because the gradients aren't independent, as they are in traditional batches.\r\n\r\n> And there is no way to backprop over different samples or preserve state from one sample to another in a batch. Am I correct?\r\n\r\nIf you could preserve state between samples in a batch then wouldn't you just have one sample?\r\n\r\nJust remember that a standard LSTM input should have 3 dimensions (batch, sequence, feature) and will iterate over the middle dimension in each batch.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"", 'Yes, I read too much and got all tied up.

Hence,for example the LSTM memory cell value for the 2nd value of X[0] (which is 2), will use the value of the memory LSTM cell state computed with the 1st value of X[0] (which is 1) and so on until all the time_window_size number of values in X[0] are processed and the final output is computed. The latter will be compared against Y[0] etc.. Same is happening for X[1].

Did you have any luck?\r\n@bstriner maybe you could advise? I feel like this could almost be a FAQ\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n`Dataset = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`\r\n`X_train = [[1,2,3,4,5],[2,3,4,5,6],[3,4,5,6,7],[4,5,6,7,8]]`\r\n`Y_train = [[6],[7],[8],[9]]`\r\n\r\nGiven time-series dataset (eg. forex), learn patterns in the data to enable future prediction that:\r\n`model.predict([20,21,22,23,24])` -> `[25]`\r\n\r\n**Objectives:**\r\n- Assess (theoretically) how shifting windows approach can be improved with batch size.\r\n- Assess how windows can be implemented in a stateful model.\r\n\r\n_I'm hoping this will help myself and others deciding between stateful vs stateless LSTMs and save time implementing window forecast models. You can tune hyperparams with an algorithm to assess the prediction performance but it would be beneficial to understand the theory first!_\r\n\r\n**Stateless LSTM with windows:**\r\n\r\nBatch size of 1 would mean a single window is fed in, and size 2 would mean two windows are passed in training before LSTM weights are updated.\r\n\r\nI was of the understanding [eg. from this article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/understanding-stateful-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/) (by @jbrownlee) that a batch size containing all the windows would learn the sequence best:\r\n> This suggests that if we had a batch size large enough to hold all input patterns and if all the input patterns were ordered sequentially, that the LSTM could use the context of the sequence within the batch to better learn the sequence.\r\n\r\n1. To take advantage of a larger batch size learning a longer sequence, should the training be set to `shuffle = False`? \r\nShuffling will randomise the windows inside each batch, therefore losing any long term sequence found by retaining state after sequential windows. \r\neg. Shuffle True: `[[4,5,6,7,8], [2,3,4,5,6]]` False: ` [[1,2,3,4,5],[2,3,4,5,6]]` (better because the LSTM continues from the first window's state)\r\n\r\n2. Or is the whole point of window training that the network only finds patterns in each independent window rather than an entire dataset?\r\nie. if you wanted to find a pattern in a longer sequence, should you instead increase the size of each window. If this is the case, how does a larger batch size help?\r\n\r\n**Stateful LSTM:**\r\n\r\nCould the problem be solved better by a stateful LSTM? The state is maintained after each batch and reset after each epoch, meaning the data must be fed sequentially. This would let a model learn the whole dataset.\r\n\r\nFor this to succeed, the number of windows must be a multiple of the batch size for training and prediction.\r\nEg. For a batch size of 2:\r\nTrain: `[[window 1][window 2], [window3][window4], ... ]`\r\nPredict: `[window10][window11] -> [x, y]`\r\n_where x is the prediction of value after window 10 (start of window 11), and y is the prediction we care about (into the future)_\r\n\r\n3. For a stateful LSTM, should the training data not be supplied in windows of 1 step?\r\nAs the input is sequential, would the model be expecting [1-5][6-10][11-15]... instead of the current overlapping windows.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance! 沽 "", ""@bstriner I didn't find anything related to stateful lstm in  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02182.pdf paper and why it should be used in language model.

237,keras,11379,closed,ZeroPadding Dynamic for step> 1 and access the actual shape of a tensor of dimension None in Keras,"
I'm trying to implement a dynamic zero padding to keep the second dimension of a constant tensor after going through convolutional layers that have stride> 1, the input tensor has the following shape (batch_size, time_step, 50), I need the time step dimension not be changed by the convolutional layers. I tried to use 'same' padding, however when stride> 1, this does not work, so I created a custom layer for ZeroPadding, it is working for tensors with the shape (None, 100,50), (None, 120,50), (None, 60,50), but does not work for dynamic shapes of type (None, None, 50), I get the following error:



I've added my custom class to an imdb example, to make it easier to reproduce the errors. Change model.add(Embedding(max_features, embedding_dims, input_length = None)) to model.add(Embedding(max_features, embedding_dims, input_length = 400)) and dynamic padding will work, however it needs to work for dimension of type None. The code:

(left_pad, right_pad)(batch, axis_to_pad, features)(batch, padded_axis, features)

I searched and saw that I have to use K.shape (inputs), to get the correct shape at runtime, instead of None, but I could not make it work with Keras, could anyone help me?

If you have another solution to solve the problem of zero dynamic padding, it is very welcome.
The question is also in StackOverflow: [ZeroPadding Dynamic for step> 1 and access the actual shape of a tensor of dimension None in Keras](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52788133/zeropadding-dynamic-for-step-1-and-access-the-actual-shape-of-a-tensor-of-dimen)

238,keras,5326,closed,GPU runs out of memory for VGG19 & VGG16 but not for ResNet50,"Below I provide a toy example which throws an out-of-memory exception while training VGG19 or VGG16 models on GPU.

If I use a ResNet50 architecture instead, I get no error and I am able to use really big datasets & batch-sizes. Training the models on CPU works fine for all network architectures. 

The problem first appeared on a more complex pipeline that runs on p2.16xlarge AWS instances. I can reproduce the problem using Ubuntu 14.04, Keras 1.2.1 and Tensorflow 0.12.1. Can anyone reproduce the problem? Any thoughts?

So effectively what you say is that the model is too big to live in my GPU. Makes sense.\r\n\r\nI noticed that I get the same error in GPUs with more memory IF I have earlier initialised other models (in the same session). Possibly the were not garbage collected? Is there a way to ensure that a model defined earlier is removed completely from the GPU? Will a simple ""del model"" do the trick?', ""I have not tried del model. You can monitor GPU usage with nvidia-smi (if not using CNMeM). \r\nUsually I start a fresh python session. Maybe there is a trick do release the model, but I don't know it."", 'I tried del and forcing gc but does not work. I am going to close this ticket and it is not a bug and ask how to release memory of previous models on the different issue. \r\n\r\nThanks so much @unrealwill for your help. You were spot on.', '@datumbox: The `del` keyword in Python only releases main memory allocated by your Python script. In order to release the memory on the GPU, you could use `K.clear_session()` where `K` refers to your Keras backend.', ""@unrealwill Is there something fundamentally different in the way memory is implemented on Tensorflow vs Theano?  The Theano vgg16 model has no problem running on my 4GB graphics card wheras the TF model runs out of memory and I saw another thread talking about how it allocates 12GB of memory?  \r\n\r\nI understand they're different libraries and implemented entirely differently, but if this really is a memory issue why would one framework be able to handle it and the other not?  I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just genuinely curious.  I haven't heard that Theano is that much more efficient that Tensorflow at memory and if that's the case it changes the choice of platform I'm going to focus on."", ""One dumb thing to check: if you have a run Ctl-Z'd in the background holding the GPU memory."", '@EvenOldridge Yes, Theano only reserved the amount of memory it needed for its variables, so running multiple Theano ""sessions"" in parallel was fine if your GPU had the RAM. Tensorflow greedily reserves all the RAM on all the GPU\'s when you start a session (check out nvidia-smi when you launch). That said, Theano is officially dying soon, and I\'ve actually seen pretty substantial performance increases by switching from it to TF (not to mention absurdly faster launch times due to no runtime compilation), so you\'re probably best sticking with TF and trying to work with its design decisions.\r\n\r\n@phobrain Good point, and I\'ve also been learning, if doing keras/TF in Jupyter, make sure to kill one notebook before trying to run another.

241,keras,5425,closed,"LSTM different case of sequences, doubts in general and CNN+LSTM network for regression problem","Hello, thanks in advance for your help and for the developers of Keras!

I am working with LSTM networks, actually I am trying to create a CNN+LSTM network that takes as inputs images with 3 channels. I have been reading a lot, but I still have several doubts about how LSTM layers really work, because the results I am obtaining in my experiments are horrible, and this networks are told to give great results.
I have read #4149 and #2403 and I have clear my mind enough to know that I have to learn a lot.

First I will told you my task and then enumerate the doubts I have about recurrent layers.

My inputs are images with 3 channels, I have reshape my data set with the following code in order to have sequences in time:











And that gives me structures with the following shapes:






So if I am right, that means that I have nb_samples=2126 (number of samples), each sample is a sequence of length 2 and each element of that sequence is an image of 3 channels and dimensions 10x8, am I right?

My outputs is a matrix of dimensions , so each input image has associated 3 numbers as outputs. What I want is to feed my net with my input sequences of image so each sequence has the image for t-1 and t, I want my net to give me as output the 3 numbers associated with the image at time t. I have read a lot about problems where the sequences are t-1,t and the output is t+1, but I want the output that correspond to the last element of my input sequence.

Having this in mind, I don't know if that is what I am doing with this net:















So as long as I knew, with  I make sure that the convolutional layer is applayed to each element in the sequence separated. And I added  in the first LSTM layer to connect with the second LSTM layer. Finally the Dense layer is to obtain the 3 outputs I need.

And here comes my doubts (generals and about my problem):

1. With this network, am I calculating the output of the last element of the sequences or the output of the future instant t+1?

2. Are my data reshape right?

3. I don't really understand all the parameters the LSTM and recurrent layers have (I have read the keras documentation but it is not clear to me). Moreover, I don't understand the difference between the cases in this image:
![e4cdf91c-063f-11e6-8844-c89a9e134339](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25105487/23065901/1db65978-f518-11e6-8915-2c57668e714e.png)

I don't understand the difference and I don't know how can I programm the layer to obtain the different cases.

4. I have read that is recommended to use  instead of  to connect the cnn layer with the lstm layer, but to me, the reshape is not working.

5. Am I using well the  layer? 
I have read this : [https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/imdb_cnn_lstm.py](url)
I know is 1D instead of 2D, but in that example they don't use TimeDistributed nor  layer.


I think that's all for the moment. Sorry about the big post, and hope some of you could help me.",stale,"[""Hello,\r\n\r\n5 Yes\r\n\r\n4 You are using TimeDistributed(Flatten()), so this is correct.\r\n\r\n3 Currently your architecture is many-to-one.

(More exactly you are calculating an output based on the information contained on all elements of your sequence)\r\n\r\nThe fact that your seq_length=2 is confusing because LSTM use all information before t, not just t-1 and t (which is true in your case because seq_length=2). If you just want to use only information t-1 and t then use masked convolutions.\r\n\r\nBecause your seq_length=2 you are not really using the power of LSTM, and you maybe missing the point.\r\nFinally many-to-one architecture are harder to train because that is fundamentally a harder problem, because the network doesn't know in what timestep is the relevant information, and the network has to save this relevant information in its internal state, so its not easy, specially with layer sizes so small.\r\n\r\n"", ""Hi, thanks for replying! \r\n\r\nAbout point 3, how do you know my problem is many-to-one? I think I would like to have a one-to-one network. Anyway I will check the Repeat layer you told me. \r\n\r\nIn the case I would need the many-to-one architecture, I should increase the seq_len and the numbers of blocks in the LSTM layer, is it?\r\nThe fact is that for my problem I can't have a seq_len too large, the ideal was to have seq_len=2, so you recommend me to use only convolutions layers? I was very stucked because I have read about the amazing results of the CNN+LSTM, so I thought it could work for my problem.\r\n\r\nThanks about point 2!"", 'Hello,\r\nYour problem take a sequence of seq_length (=2 =many) as input, and produce a single (=one) output. \r\nIf you want to have a one-to-one network, just concatenate( Merge(mode=""concat"") )  your input sequence into a vector of 2 times the dim.\r\n\r\nLayers should have usually between 100 and 1000 units.

HINT: Re-running with most Theano optimization disabled could give you a back-trace of when this node was created. This can be done with by setting the Theano flag 'optimizer=fast_compile'. If that does not work, Theano optimizations can be disabled with 'optimizer=None'.
## HINT: Use the Theano flag 'exception_verbosity=high' for a debugprint and storage map footprint of this apply node.

I guess that the obtained error may result from passing the fix-sized matrix C into my loss. Anybody can kindly help me to solve this issue? Thank you very much.

**Describe the current behavior**  
It crashes when I hit F5 in Spyder.  It talks about pickle error.



**Describe the expected behavior**  

I would expect it to get to line 29 and print something about the training sequence count.

Line 28, where it is choking, is 


It doesn't get to print ""train sequences"" after attempting to load data, so it isn't getting past line 29.  

When I re-select line 28, and hit F9 (run highlighted) it gives the same error again.

254,keras,10875,closed,Multi-thread online training for multiple copies of a model,"Hello.
My task is to create cetrain amount of copies of the same network and run each in a separate thread, where they are waiting for data given batch at a time and once they received the data they should make a training step. I am using Keras + Tensorflow on GPU.

First problem that I ran into that simply creating a model in one thread and then trying to train it in another has to be handled with setting a graph and a session, otherwise I was getting an exception of trying to work with nodes from one graph summing up to nodes of another.
When I created separate sessions and graphs for each of the nodes and was specifying it with session.as_default and graph.as_default it was working, but the more processes I am running, the more TF sessions are created and they are completely slowing down the calculations. So I returned to the idea of having one session only, that I am getting via keras.backend.get_session() and using everywhere together with graph of this session.
But here the behavior becomes completely random. It might run without errors (for 1 and 2 workers), it might give an error of initialization

260,keras,12679,closed,Feature Request: Accept None as target size for ImageDataGenerator,"I came across this article: https://www.fast.ai/2018/04/30/dawnbench-fastai/#imagenet and I wanted to try implementing dynamic image sizes using ImageDataGenerator and keras applications models (those with global pooling layer). This is to allow the model to accept any input shape for progressively increasing input shape during training, as well as training a variety of image sizes without having to resize the input. However, there are a few problems I encountered.

First, keras.preprocessing.ImageDataGenerator does not accept None or (None, None) as target size. When target_size=(None, None):

When target_size=None:


Also, while most keras applications models seem to accept (None, None, 3) as input shape, it doesn't seem to work with NASNet and ResNeXt. Here is the error when I get for ResNeXt for example:


Dynamic input shape may also break other models due to some implementation detail depending on input shape. For example, in a keras-contrib's implementation of ResNet, the stride value for Conv2D requires this calculation which will break if input shape is (None, None, 3)


It would really be great if ImageDataGenerator can support None type for target size for those fully convolutional networks and image models with global pooling which do not require a fixed input size.

I know 2.0.8 is a little bit old, however, I observe an issue with 2.0.8 compared with 2.0.4. I don't if it is fixed in the latest version, if not, hope it will give you some information for next updates.

When I run the code with 2.0.8, it will pop out the error message like below:

I believe this may be possible at present by setting  and manually entering  to be less than the actual number that will be used. 

However, I think this is a useful enough feature that it could deserve its own option. Perhaps we could call it  which automatically sets , checks to be sure that mini-batches are being used, and either correctly sets , or ignores thae last  of the mini-batches after each reshuffle by adding a couple lines of extra code to the fitting routine.

281,keras,9758,closed,zoom_range in ImageDataGenerator uses different scales for x and y,"I noticed that ImageDataGenerator, when setting the parameter zoom_range, uses a different random transformation for the horizontal and vertical axis, which produces images with a random aspect ratio.

I checked the source code ([here](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/keras/preprocessing/image.py#L853)) and the zoom transformation is indeed random for the horizontal and vertical axis. I think this is counterintuitive because I'm expecting a ""zoom"" transformation to simply magnify (or unmagnify) the input image. Instead, the output of zoom_range are images which are randomly stretched horizontally or vertically.

I suggest introducing an additional parameter like a boolean ""zoom_keep_ar"" (aspect ratio) which if True, keeps the aspect ratio constant (simple magnification, zx=zy=random), if False it also randomly change the aspect ratio (zx=rand, zy=rand).",,"['I agree.

282,keras,10890,closed,Add Dice Loss (and Intersection Over Union),"I propose that Dice Score/Loss (also known as F1-score or Sorensen score) is added as a metric and loss function as these are very commonly used in image segmentation or bounding box problems. Within the medical community, this is an incredibly important function, although I have seen it in other areas like [astronomy](https://github.com/jakeret/tf_unet).

Additionally, the Intersection Over Union (IoU) (also known as Jaccard Index) is another important metric/loss for these same classes of problem. While the Dice and IoU are very similar functions, the Dice Score weights true positives (the intersection) more heavily than false positives and false negatives than IoU (which gives a more even weighting to TP, FP, & FN). In cases where false positives and false negatives can be very detrimental, the IoU will produce a better result than Dice. Andrew Ng (Stanford Prof, Google Brain co-founder, Coursera founder) even devotes an [entire video](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/convolutional-neural-networks/intersection-over-union-p9gxz) to IoU in his convolutional neural networks (CNN's) course as the metric to use to determine if your bounding box predictions are working.

According to Pull #7032 which sought to add Dice, the end result was the request was closed and that it will only be added if the community continues to bring it up and express interest in adding Dice ([See Comment](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/7032#issuecomment-311459497) by @fchollet ).

As time has passed and interest in CNN's has [skyrocketed](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?cat=174&date=all&geo=US&q=convolutional%20neural%20network), I suggest that we reconsider adding Dice and IoU as they are becoming more and more common place. Dice has been proposed or mentioned in issues and pull requests multiple times (#292, #369, #2115, #2994, #3442, #3457, #3611, #3653, #3977, #5916, #6933, #7032, #8961, #9154, #9275, #9395, #9444, #9671, #10783). Additionally, IoU has also been mentioned a number of times in this repository (#2016, #2185, #6467, #6538, #8225, #8643, #8669, #9367, #10104, #10602, #10783). Keep in mind that those references are only with in _this_ repository... there are plenty of other Github repositories that use Dice and/or IoU as a loss function.

Furthermore, the research community has used Dice or IoU in numerous papers that make use of CNN's. Here are a few that each have over 100 citations according to Google Scholar, though many more exist...

I personally have been working in medical research with a U-Net for image segmentation and have found that training the model with binary cross entropy as my loss function at first and then switching to dice loss for additional training has significantly improved my performance over using only binary cross entropy. I have been using a custom loss to use Dice loss, however, it would be great to see an official version of this supported by Keras.

Given that over a year has past since PR #7032, would the Keras team reconsider implementing an official version of Dice and IoU loss functions?",type:feature,"['Any updates on this?', ""For anyone interested in this, I've implemented an IoU metric for evaluating semantic segmentation results [here](https://gist.github.com/Kautenja/69d306c587ccdf464c45d28c1545e580). I'd be happy to merge it into the Keras codebase."", 'I can also confirm that these metrics are important to segmentation tasks in the biometric domain.

An official implementation would be deeply appreciated! ', ""After working with the I/U metrics for some time with Keras, I noticed unexpected values compared to reported baselines. After reviewing how metrics are calculated in Keras, I discovered that they are calculated batch-wise and averaged together. This is contrary to how I/U is typically calculated for semantic segmentation tasks, i.e., over an entire subset of data. Batch-wise I/U may be useful in certain contexts and applications, so a simple I/U metric built in may still be worth considering. However, correct semantic segmentation evaluation necessitates a novel solution. \r\n\r\nPotential solutions I've considered to correctly calculate I/U dataset-wise:\r\n\r\n1.  set batch size equal to size of dataset\r\n    -   terrible space complexity, infeasible for large datasets\r\n    -   restricts training configurations\r\n2.  aggregating a global confusion matrix to calculate I/U from\r\n    -   memory efficient, just needs a single CxC matrix to add to\r\n    -   hard to implement (requires a complementary callback for advanced functionality)\r\n        -   how to allocate the CxC matrix on training start?\r\n        -   how to reset to zero between epochs?\r\n        -   how to reset to zero for a validation/evaluation set?\r\n        -   how to access effectively to calculate I/U?\r\n3.  write external methods to evaluate models using above technique, but with NumPy\r\n    -   memory efficient, just needs a single CxC matrix to add to    \r\n    -   easy to implement\r\n    -   does not integrate with Keras model fitting (training / validation)\r\n    -   no GPU acceleration for calculating confusion matrices batch-wise\r\n4.  write a callback to calculate I/U for a validation dataset\r\n    -   easy to implement\r\n    -   integrates with Keras well (i.e., free GPU acceleration)\r\n    -   contradicts some standard Keras API (e.g., validation data args in fit, fit_generator)\r\n        -   doesn't integrate with other metrics baked into the model\r\n    -   no output for training or evaluation metrics\r\n    -   have to reimplement accuracy metrics in NumPy to evaluate (easy with confusion matrix)\r\n\r\nI ended up using tek 3 to implement SegNet and Tiramisu in Keras as it's the simplest solution and I only really needed test time I/U metrics anyway as loss and accuracy are enough for the training process.

The numerators (`tf.reduce_sum(onehots_true * probabilities, axis=0)`, prior to their weighting) look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntf.Tensor(\r\n[3.42069e+01 0.00000e+00 9.43506e+03 7.88478e+01 1.50554e-02 0.00000e+00\r\n 1.22765e+01 4.36149e-01 1.75026e+02 0.00000e+00 2.33183e+02 1.81064e-01\r\n 0.00000e+00 1.60128e+02 1.48867e+04 0.00000e+00 3.87697e+00 4.49753e+02\r\n 5.87062e+01 0.00000e+00 0.00000e+00], shape=(21,), dtype=float32)\r\ntf.Tensor(1.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich also looks reasonable, since they're basically the labels' respective sizes times the network's certainty about them (which is likely low in the beginning of training). The denominators (`tf.reduce_sum(onehots_true + probabilities, axis=0)`, prior to weighting) also look fine:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntf.Tensor(\r\n[ 14053.483   25004.557  250343.36    66548.234    6653.863    3470.502\r\n   5318.3926 164206.19    19914.338    1951.0701   3559.3235   7248.4717\r\n   5984.786    7902.9004 133984.66    41497.473   25010.273   22232.062\r\n  26451.926   66250.39     6497.735 ], shape=(21,), dtype=float32)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are large, but that is to be expected since the class probabilities of a pixel sum to 1, and therefore the sum of these denominators should more or less equal the amount of pixels with ground truth.\r\n\r\nHowever, summing the numerators gives a very small sum (~0.001, though occasionally it's in a single digit range) while the denominator sums to very large values. This results in my final loss being exclusively 1, or something really close to that. Does anyone know how I can mitigate this effect and obtain stable gradients?"", 'Would it be possible to request this as a loss in [`tensorflow/addons`](https://www.tensorflow.org/addons/api_docs/python/tfa/losses), rather than Keras?']",[],[],0,0

Excuse me for this question without much details, because I'm bound with time in order to post my results on a challenge platform, anyway I try to sum up as much as I can. I have a multivariate time-series, that I trained using an RNN, there are periods and repeating time indexes, from 2013-01 to 2016-09, steps are months, by repeating, I mean various subsets ordered from January to December, many times for the same year, for hundreds of times, and I am predicting the next year knowing other features. I trained using LSTM, on 3 years, and trying to predict also repeating time-series for the year 2017. I used fixed batch size, and one last layer for binary target value so I used such a basic neural network:



The batch size is 12 ( I chose) for 12 months, the target in train is very unbalanced with



the problem is that predicting on test like

I have used Keras wrappers for Scikit to implement Adaboost for single input Keras models. This solution works fine for Dense layers, but not for 3D layers. The moment I try to use any 3D layers such as LSTM or SimpleRNN, the first model training runs ok but immediately thereafter I get the following error message.
ValueError: Input 0 of layer simple_rnn_1 is incompatible with the layer: expected ndim=3, found ndim=2. Full shape received: [None, 3]
(To recreate this error, please install scikit-nightly build 0.22.dev0. The stable 0.21 release does not allow the Adaboost class fit method to take 3D arrays required by LSTM.)

I.e. See https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyGBdo0qFm\r\n\r\nGenerally, I agree. The different approach taken in e.g. [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf) is of great importance and should be considered for any seq2seq problem. However (!) I\'d claim that any feedforward architecture can already be supported by the existing Keras API. You might have to write several custom layers but feedforward attention can be implemented by reusing, and without duplicating, major parts of the existing API (along the lines of @farizrahman4u commet cited [above](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/11172#issuecomment-422329888))\r\n\r\nRecurrent attention is different; if you want to implement it in a new layer/model you need to reimplement the majority of the RNN logic _or wrap the cell_ as is suggested in the previous [PR](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/8296).\r\n\r\nThat said, it might still make sense to add layers or models to the API for non-recurrent attention. But I think it is still high prio to support _recurrent_ attention as was initially in the ""request for contributions"".\r\n', 'In a sense, I think recurrent attention ""is also supported"" since we added [support for constants](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/7980) in the RNN - you can quite easily write your own cell wrapper. To me, It\'s just a question of how standardized and simple you want to make this and if/what ready (cell-wrapper) attention mechanisms should be added to the API.\r\n\r\nThe main current limitation with this approach is that there is no option to return ""state sequences"" from the RNN, which is required to feed the attention encoding from on layer to subsequent layers (see point [3) here](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/8296#issue-149413767)).  ', 'Ok. So usage workflow examples have been requested. Since the heading of this and all preceding issues/PRs has been *recurrent* attention I\'ll focus on this and repeat/clarify the workflow of the only concrete suggestion so far. I\'ll use the architecture in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0850.pdf) for handwriting synthesis as the use-case (but the workflow would be the same for e.g. this kind [image captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf))\r\n```\r\nxy = Input((None, 2))  # coordinates of handwriting trajectory\r\ntext = Input((None, n_characters))  # sequence of characters to be synthesized\r\n\r\ncell = MixtureOfGaussian1DAttention(LSTMCell(64), components=3, heads=2)\r\nattention_lstm = RNN(cell, return_sequences=True)\r\nh = attention_lstm(xy, constants=text)\r\nxy_pred = TimeDistributed(Dense(2, activation=None))(h)\r\n# MoG output is used instead of basic regression in the original paper, but this is has nothing to do with the attention mechanism and is left out for brevity.\r\n\r\nmodel = Model(inputs=[xy, text], outputs=xy_pred)\r\nmodel.compile(optimizer=\'adam\', loss=\'mse\')\r\nmodel.fit([xy_data[:, :-1], text_data], xy_data[:, 1:])\r\n```\r\nI think that this workflow is perfectly aligned with [Keras guiding principles](https://github.com/keras-team/keras#guiding-principles). Note that no modification of existing classes is required, we\'ve just defined a new `RNNCell`. For the sake of modularity it reuses/wraps the `LSTMCell`, which can be replaced by e.g. the `GRUCell`. This use-case and workflow were one of the main drivers for breaking out the `RNNCell` and adding support for `constants` in the `RNN`.\r\n\r\nI honestly can\'t come up with a reasonable alternative based on the Model subclassing API for this use case. I guess these are other options:\r\n\r\n```\r\nattention_lstm = MixtureOfGaussian1DAttentionRNN(\r\n    cell=LSTMCell(64),\r\n    components=3,\r\n    heads=2,\r\n    return_sequences=True\r\n)\r\nh = attention_lstm(xy, attended=text)\r\n```\r\nHere, `MixtureOfGaussian1DAttentionRNN` would be a standalone layer where the attention mechanism has been coupled tightly with the general `RNN` logic (why I think it is a bad option).\r\n\r\nAlternatively something like:\r\n```\r\nattention_lstm = AttentionRNN(\r\n    cell=LSTMCell(64),\r\n    attention_mechanism=MixtureOfGaussian1DAttention(components=3, heads=2),\r\n    components=3,\r\n    heads=2,\r\n    return_sequences=True  # here return_state_sequences could be supported or other\r\n)\r\nh = attention_lstm(xy, attended=text)\r\n```\r\nWhere both the core cell and and attention mechanism are injected into an new class that connects them. But this requires new interfaces both for the `attention_mechanism` and for the `AttentionRNN` which seems completely unnecessary since the existing `RNNCell` interacface already supports attentive cells (thanks to addition of `constants`).\r\n\r\n**Bottom Line**\r\n1) Is this use-case at all of relevans!?\r\n2) Is there any problem with the suggested approach? If so, please be concrete and/or provide an alternative!\r\n3) If we can agree that _recurrent_ attention is already supported by using an appropriate (attentive) `RNNCell` - do you feel that there is a need to add ""standard"" attentive cells, such as `MixtureOfGaussian1DAttention` in this example, to the official keras API?\r\n\r\n@fchollet @farizrahman4u @gabrieldemarmiesse ', '* Thinking in terms of reducing the number of mental models (cognitive load), I vote for the first one.\r\n\r\n* Even in that case, I think the ""MixtureOfGaussian1DAttention"" wrapper is too niche to make its way into the core api (I might be wrong). \r\n\r\n* We definitely need a standard way to do attention in Keras. I think we should come up with an end to end example, which includes the attention wrapper definition that users can easily extend. For simplicity, use the simplest attention mechanism possible.(`MixtureOfGaussian1DAttention` has too many moving parts).\r\n', 'I have a feeling that some uncertainty comes from the (motivated!) fuzz about non-recurrent attention mechanisms. If we were to add support for the transformer architecture in [Attention is All you Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf) (or the recent [BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf)), I definitely think that Model subclassing API is a good place to start - because there are many intricate parts that should be combined the right way. It would look something like:\r\n```\r\ninput_sequence = Input((None, 1))\r\ntarget_sequence_tm1 = Input((None, 1))\r\ntransformer = Tranformer(\r\n    input_tokens=n_input_tokens,  # must be provided if embeddings created internally\r\n    target_tokens=n_target_tokens,  # must be provided if embeddings created internally\r\n    units_model=512,\r\n    units_ff=2048,\r\n    units_keys=64,\r\n    units_values=64,\r\n    layers=6,\r\n    heads=3\r\n)\r\ntarget_sequence_pred = transformer([input_sequence, target_sequence_tm1])\r\n```\r\nWhere `Tranformer` would subclass `Model`. It could also be motivated to expose some of the internals as separate sub-models or layers, which raises the question if the same ""Attention layers"" can be reused both in the feedforward and recurrent setting. This would be possible (as per my previous suggestion) by defining cell transformations using the functional API, e.g.:\r\n```\r\n# define complete attentive cell using functional API\r\nunits = 32\r\nxy_t = Input((2,))\r\ntext = Input((None, n_characters))  # note that this is a sequence\r\nh_tm1 = Input((units,))\r\nc_tm1 = Input((units,))\r\nh_att_t = AttentionMechanism(inputs=concatenate([xy_t, h_tm1]), attended=text)\r\nx_t = concatenate([xy_t, h_att_t])\r\nh_t, c_t = LSTMCell(units)(inputs=x_t, states=[h_tm1, c_tm1])\r\ncell = CellModel(  # creates a valid cell implementation based on functional definition\r\n    inputs=xy_t,\r\n    outputs=h_t,\r\n    input_states=[h_tm1, c_tm1],\r\n    output_states=[h_t, c_t],\r\n    constants=text\r\n)\r\n```\r\nBut we should probably avoid considering this for now and make as few additions as possible. This is why [it was decided](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/8296#issuecomment-344007047) to not add the `RNNAttentionCell` base class to the API. ...In the end, the only API addition of the previous [PR](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/8296) was _one first attentive_ [_RNNCell_](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/8296/files#diff-9c4188ddc4dd173d80f64feed5b89412R370).', 'Thanks @farizrahman4u, makes sense.

I'm trying to implement a nonlinear TimeSeries Prediction similar to this publication: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5336098/
Though I'm not interested in using a CNN as the first layer. I have a dataset of this shape:
, which I padded with 0s to have this shape: . This works just fine with normal LSTMs.

For Bidirectional LSTM I implemented my model like this:

Unfortunately I'm getting weird results with this model which look like the model is partly ignoring the masking.

The problem with BiDirectional LSTMs and masking seems to be that by reading that data backwards, masking is once in the front (where it should be) and once in the back (where it shouldn't). Therefore I'm getting weird results. I found this old [blog post](http://dirko.github.io/Bidirectional-LSTMs-with-Keras/) which handles a similar problem though it using the old API. 

Do I need to provide distinct datasets with the padding in the correct place for each layer of the Bi-LSTM? And how would I feed that data into the model? Or should I leave the padding out completely and create batches of same size? Or even use ?

",type:support,"[""I have the same problem. Did you find out what it was? I tried setting the batch size to 1 but the test set accuracy was pretty bad compared to training on the padded data (didn't try hyperparameter tuning, e.g. learning rate, so it may be my mistake).\r\n\r\nOne aspect I was wondering about: You said you would expect the masking to be in the front, not in the back. Since I don't know the internals about what Keras/TF does with masking exactly I can't be sure but it seemed a bit counterintuitive to me. Sequence data normally has its padding at the end, so I would expect the masking to be at the end as well, not in front. But still, is it correct to have masking at the end in one case and in front in another case?\r\n\r\nAnother issue I am unsure about with Bidirectional LSTMs with masking is whether the reverse function is working correctly. I looked into the code and it seems like the reverse function simply mirrors the data, which moves the padding from the back to the front as you wrote. However, I know that there is a TF function that does intelligent reversal which mirrors the data itself but keeps the padding at the end.

If you have custom generator that inherits from this class you might need to update it (hard to provide directions without more info).

Note that the original API on 2.0.8 required you to pass always an infinite generator (else the implementation would break), so the update is supposed to allow you to use also finite ones in case you are doing destributed predictions using Spark.

315,keras,9468,closed,Reducing Memory Usage of Char-Level Text Generation by LSTMs,"First off, these examples are wonderful.  That being said, I have a question/improvement to the [char-level text generation example](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/lstm_text_generation.py).

I was trying this example out with a corpus of my own and kept running to MemoryError when allocating the training set and labels.  I noticed that both use a 1-hot encoding to indicate the activated character. 

**My question is**:  Why not bake this embedding into the model with an identity matrix before the first LSTM (basically just a character embedding layer that returns the 1-hot) and using a sparse categorical loss evaluation?  

This reduces the total in-memory usage by a factor of the number of unique characters.  Seemed to work for me when I tried it out.  

**Note**:  I was trying much longer input sequences (>100) which was why I was using a lot of memory.

318,keras,11288,closed,Python sometimes does not exit when using multiprocessing=True in fit_generator,"Hi, 

I've implemented my own generator as sequence object. If I'm using it without multi processing, it works fine. Most of the times it also does the job when using multiprocessing=True (fit_generator).

However,  SOMETIMES (unfortunately not reproducible) when using multiprocessing=True, the program does not exit after the training finished. It reaches the last line (print out the time needed for training) but then does not exit. I've to kill it with ctrl + c. Most of the times, some processes are still running and tensorflow still occupies my GPU memory. I've to kill the processes then manually by kill -s 9 id .

I think it might be a problem with my generator:
https://gist.github.com/thorstenwagner/8033f43b99d1d3a1a6a31b054d91e7fc

However, I cannot nail it down to a specific line. I did my best to make it multi threading save.

I observed this problem with Keras 2.2.0, 2.2.2 and 2.2.3. I've tested tensorflow-gpu 1.8.0 and tensorflow-gpu 1.10.1 as backend. I had this problem with python 2 and with python 3.6.

Any ideas what might be problem?

Best,
Thorsten

Today:
I have to implement this layer either as a Lambda or a custom layer, both of which simply wrap . This causes huge headaches for exporting to CoreML and TF-Lite. Existing layers like  and  do not meet my needs, since I am downsampling to a fixed output size, so scaling by some factor does not work.

CoreML has a built-in  layer, but it is difficult to connect my custom Keras layer with that CoreML built-in.

Ideal solution:
There is a built-in Keras layer, I ask the CoreML team to use it, they implement a new layer conversion mapping, and I convert my model without digging into the guts of both Keras and CoreML.

In the above code I considered each video separately and then each video was divided to different frame sequences with length 500 (except last sequence frame for each video because the length of frames are not divisible by 500). The training accuracy and test accuracy are same as below.

    Epoch1 : accuracy training = 0.3694     accuracy testing = 0.3927
             loss training = 1.146          loss testing = 1.109

             loss training = 1.053          loss testing = 1.109
    Epoch3 : accuracy training = 0.5017     accuracy testing = 0.4236
             loss training = 0.994          loss testing = 1.115
    Epoch4 : accuracy training = 0.5491     accuracy testing = 0.4099
             loss training = 0.94           loss testing = 1.124
    Epoch5: accuracy training = 0.5612      accuracy testing = 0.4013
            loss training = 0.924           loss testing = 1.128
    Epoch6 : accuracy training = 0.6142     accuracy testing = 0.4113
             loss training = 0.859          loss testing = 1.137
    Epoch7 : accuracy training = 0.6263     accuracy testing = 0.4116
             loss training = 0.824          loss testing = 1.142
    Epoch8 : accuracy training = 0.6659     accuracy testing = 0.415
             loss training = 0.775          loss testing = 1.152

 

After 100 epochs training accuracy increases while testing accuracy doesn't improve. If the case is ""overfitting"" adding dropout layer should help which didn't. So, I am confused about the cause. 

Any idea or suggestion would be appreciated.

It works fine. But it does\'t add histograms for weights and bias.\r\nHow  can we add histograms for these ?  It窶s clear now. It works if we get weights, bias and so on from tensorflow default graphｼ not keras\'s layers. In tensorflow, tf.trainable_variables() get all trainable variables besides weights and bias.

Here's the steps to reproduce:
1. Build any model with one or more batch norm layers.  In my case it was a functional API model, although I doubt that is necessary to reproduce.
2. run model.predict() (wrap it in a timer of some sort)

### Description

I use  to clone the resnet50 model and use   to set the weights for each layer. But I find that the time consumption for each iteration becomes much larger as time goes by. At the first iteration, the clone stage takes about 4 seconds and the setting-weights stage takes about 3 seconds but those turn to be 34 seconds and 4 minutes at the 50th iteration. 

Is there a problem with my usage? Or would there be a memory leak in keras?

I hope to hear from you soon. Thanks in advance.

335,keras,11493,closed,Introduction of Sobolev training capability in Keras,"Hi,

This is a feature request that I think could be interesting for several users and I wish to share it, as I am not able to implement it.
In the field of scientific computing (especially Computational Fluid Dynamic), there are more and more attempts to use neural network to speed up expensive iterative computations. It can be done in two ways:

- by improving the quality of the initialisation the computation with a neural network

- for computation based on Jacobian evaluation (such as Newton-Raphson), by estimating the Jacobian with a neural network.

In such cases, it is quite common to have access to the derivatives of the function one want to learn, therefore another kind of training can be used : Sobolev training : https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04859

In such a training, the cost function is not only dependant of the output values of the neural network and the ground truth, but a term depending of the derivatives of the outputs with regards to the inputs is added. This requires to provide also the ground truth derivatives to the learning process.

It would be great to have to possibility to provide the derivatives values in Keras with a call like :



 being the matrices of the derivatives of the outputs with regards to the inputs.

The quality of the training is improved, as in addition of the knowledge of the output value, one use also the available knowledge of the derivative of the outputs with regards to the inputs. This would require to compute also for the learning process the derivative of the output of the network with regards to its inputs, in order to be able to do the gradient based update.

Once the learning process is achieved, both outputs values and derivatives values would have been learn in a single neural networks and it accessing to the values of the derivatives would be adding value to the information gathered by such a training, that means being able to call:

336,keras,13098,closed,About the reloading problem of input layers assigned by tensor,"1. Problem description

When I design input layers via assigning tensors including constants, variables and etc. to avoid direct input, in not reloading the model, training and predicting are valid. However, after saving the model and reloading it, input layers via assigning tensors are loaded as direct input layers without constant and variable tensors. I want to load an originally designed model with designing loss.

input1 = Input(shape=(10, 1))
input2 = Input(tensor=K.random_normal_variable((10, 1), 0, 1))
input3 = Input(tensor=K.random_normal((10, 1)))

339,keras,12524,closed,Neural Networks with no input (dummy) to optimise transformed output?,"Hello, 

I would like to create either a) a deep dense neural net that has n outputs with no activation function (for example, 3 numbers output) or b) an RNN that internally performs the same based on observed effects. So, I want to say, feed it stationary values of X=1 Y=1 but reconsider what the loss value is for the three inputs, in order to train to optimise my function

My issue is that I need to transform the output before the loss is given, eg:


Where: 

- Loss is the _true loss_ of the network
- my_function accepts the three outputs of the network at each step (a, b and c), rounded to integers
- my_function returns a float between 0.0 and 100.0 where 0.0 is the worst and 100.0 is the best possible value

Is it possible to get the network to learn from the above my_function as true loss? I've been trying for days to implement it. I can return the value of my_function() from my code, but when I input this code inside a custom loss function it just executes once at the start (TF Graphs).

Is there any way I can replace my loss with the above function using a Lambda layer, custom loss function or even a callback? I'm not sure how to do this, or if it's even possible (?)

This question seems to be aiming for a somewhat similar goal: https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/2691
but unfortunately I'm not quite good enough at Keras (yet!) to apply it to my problem

Help would be much appreciated,
Thanks

i converted my MLP Network to an LSTM Network to check if i can get a better accuracy taking
the time into consideration. I have sound signals that are split into multiple frames (87 Frames each sound signal) and 39 Features generated from those Frames (Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients).
In my MLP Network i had a input dimension of 39 Feautres and in the LSTM Network i had to reshape
this vector to 3D Tensor and decided to have those 87 frames as timesteps. (It might make more sense to put this value higher).

So from  i reshaped the vector to  .
my output vector  also had to be reshaped from  to

of the many-to-many (categories) nature of my classification problem.

here is the split and reshape part:

on the timesteps the dimensionalty of the 3D Tensor changes.

the keras function to categorical changes my 3D tensor back to 2D Tensor, so i have to reshape again.
Is there another way how tho accomplish this?

343,keras,11097,closed,Usefulness of Phased LSTM-CNN,"Hi all,

in the last weeks I was successful in setting up a Convolutional LSTM using the layers provided by keras (https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/keras/layers/convolutional_recurrent.py).

For another task in the past I did some experiments with Phased LSTM (https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09513), which also has been implemented in keras and Tensorflow.

Now, I have these things on my mind:

1. The Phased LSTM model seems really useful for many purposes. Yet, it didn't get really popular over the last years, and I'm wondering about potential reasons. Do I miss any strong counter-arguments, or have there been successful alternative approaches to tackle the same issues (like input from different sources and irregular sampling intervals)?

2. In practice, these two methods should be compatible, right? A ""time gate"" could also be included in an LSTM-CNN setting, analogous to its application in a classical LSTM. Yet, since I couldn't find any implementation, I wonder if there might be any hurdles I'm not aware of.

3. If the first points do not disqualify the idea already, feel free to get in contact with me if you would like to cooperate on its implementation.

Thanks!

I have around 200k 64x64x3 RGB images of patches of terrain that a robot drove over. Each patch has a corresponding label of what the roughness of that image patch is. The roughness values range from 0-160. The data was collected with the robot driving at varying speeds, hence the range of the roughness values. My aim is to be able to predict the roughness of a patch. I am using the VGG-16 network, with the last layer modified to do regression. My batch size is 1024, the loss is mean sqaured error, the optimize is rmsprop. The network is shown below. My problem is that after training, the network predicts the exact same value for each test image. Another point to note is that the training loss is always higher than the validation loss which is odd. Lastly I tried with other optimizers such as SGD and Adam, as well as varying batch sizes. Right now I am trying to train the network from scratch but it does not seem too promising. I am not sure what is going wrong here, and I would really appreciate any help I can get. Thanks

The documentation mentions that [ can contain arguments to the the fit method](https://keras.io/scikit-learn-api/#wrappers-for-the-scikit-learn-api) (among others) but I am unable to figure out how to use  to pass callbacks to the fit function inside the  class.

Does anyone know how I should use  and  with this setup?

",,"[""I believe it's like this\n\n`classifier = KerasClassifier(build_fn=DNN, nb_epoch=32, batch_size=8, callbacks=[your_callback], verbose=1)`\n\naccording to [documentation](https://keras.io/scikit-learn-api/)\n"", ""When I attempted adding the kwarg to the KerasClassifier during a grid search as @Hudler instructs, it resulted in the error documented here #4081 . I have no idea how to solve this from within Keras, but I was able pass the callback to the fit_params kwarg of GridSearchCV.  It looks like cross_val_score also accepts the fit_params kwarg. \n\n@kaspermarstal Can you try changing this: \n`results = cross_val_score(classifier, x, encoded_y, cv=kfold, verbose=1)` \ninto this: \n`results = cross_val_score(classifier, x, encoded_y, cv=kfold, verbose=1, fit_params={'callbacks': [EarlyStopping(), TensorBoard()]})`\n\nn.b. Don't forget to add your own parameters for both EarlyStopping and TensorBoard unless you are using the defaults.\n"", '@jfr311 Sadly there is another problem. This creates one instance of the Callback which is passed to all fit() calls. I tried using ModelCheckpoint in GridSearchCV and I can see that in first epoch model is not saved because it compares its error against error reached in previous split. \n', ""Hmm, it seems the best solution overall would be to edit the KerasClassifier such that its constructor sets the parameter 'callbacks' so that each fit call receives it's own instance of Callback, but this may introduce other problems or may not produce the expected results due to its interaction with scikit-learn's clone method.\n\nIn the mean time, I suppose you could look into the ModelCheckpoint code and override the method 'on_train_begin' or 'on_train_end' to ensure a new file is created or that the previous results are remove from the instance after being saved to file. There would have to be some logic for creating new file names as to not overwrite the previous results.\n"", 'Thank you for your inputs! @jr311 passing callbacks for fit_params of GridSearchCV indeed does the trick! However the method @Hudler suggested seems more appropriate to me and this is also perhaps the intended interface since it is in the documentation. Is the project interested in a patch @fchollet? \n', ""Well both options suffer from the same problem. You won't be able to make use of callback in cv in most cases, unless you tweak your keras.\n"", ""I'm simply using the first listed method in the documentation: \n\n> Values passed to the dictionary arguments of fit, predict, predict_proba, and score methods\n\nGridSearchCV's fit_params argument is used to pass a dictionary to the fit method of the base estimator, the KerasClassifier in this case.\n\nUpon further investigation it looks like when the callback is passed to sk_params and then the estimator is cloned by GridSearchCV, two different instances of the callback are created. Thus the sanity check in clone fails when comparing that the original callback instance and the cloned callback instance (line 117 in sklearn\\base.py).\n\nIn an attempt to allow callbacks to be passed to sk_params. I added callbacks to the constructor of the BaseWrapper as so:\n\n`def __init__(self, build_fn=None, callbacks=[], **sk_params):`\n  `self.build_fn = build_fn`\n  `self.callbacks = callbacks`\n  `self.sk_params = sk_params`\n  `self.sk_params['callbacks'] = callbacks\n`   self.check_params(sk_params)`\n\nThen I added self.callbacks to the get_params method of the same class:\n\n`def get_params(self, deep=True):`\n  `res = copy.deepcopy(self.sk_params)`\n  `res.update({'build_fn': self.build_fn, 'callbacks': self.callbacks})`\n  `return res`\n\nAfter testing with my model using callbacks and not using callbacks, no more errors arise and my callbacks function as intended. I don't think this deserves a PR simply because it is already possible to pass in callbacks and the unexpected behavior of ModelCheckpoint is due to that callback's implementation.\n\n@Hudler, I believe this change allows different instances of ModelCheckpoint to be passed to each fit call, but since each instance would have the same file name for saving the checkpoints, it may end up overwriting the file at the begin of the following fit call.\n"", 'Does someone solve this in order to `EarlyStopping` (and possibly other callbacks) work with `GridSearchCV` with cross-validation? I think that the solution would be to somehow compute the `val_loss` on test data from cv.   So `GridSearchCV` must pass test data from cv to `model.fit(validation_data=(X_test, y_test))`.

To randomize the dataset I set . I take these images from two folders (one for the image and other for the mask), so I use two  with the same seed. However, in practice that doesn't work and the mask extracted doesn't correspond to the extracted image. Both images (image and mask) have the same file name.

The problem is that the filenames from the data directories are read in a different order. To solve that I have added the next line to the DirectoryIterator at the end of his __init__ function.

## Description

mobilenet.1.00.224-imagenet_origin0-NAI1-LS1-GF1-GF2.h5 is a model for image classification. We find something strange when we run this model for some inputs. When we load this model in Keras, this model works well on the backend of CNTK, but when we configure Tensorflow or Theano as the backend of Keras, the output of this model is NaN, which seems quite strange.

We attach the .h5 file, input image and the code below. The phenomenon I described above can be reproduced using this command:

Someone in #3477 suggests to remove the  parameter from the validation generator, then I get results of 365/800=45% and 89% from evaluate_generator.

Is there something wrong with my evaluation or is this due to a bug? There are many similar issues (e.g. #3849, #6245) where the stated accuracy (during training and afterwards) doesn't match the actual predictions. Could someone experienced maybe shine some light onto this problem? Thanks

**Describe the current behavior**
I am going through Francois Chollet's book ""Deep Learning with Python"" and running the code in his Jupyter Notebooks with Tensorflow 2.0.0 as a backend to Keras 2.3.0.  Notebook 6.3, (under the heading ""1.6 Using recurrent dropout to fight overfitting"") has a model with a tensorflow.keras.layers.GRU(32, dropout=0.2, recurrent_dropout=0.2, input_shape=(None, float_data.shape[-1])).  The data is read earlier in the notebook from jena_climate_2009_2016.csv. I get a loss of 699013271268870062080.0000 after the first epoch and similar figures after subsequent epochs.  This figure is simply wrong (see below).  The original notebook (from Francois Chollet) is here: [link to github](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks/blob/master/6.3-advanced-usage-of-recurrent-neural-networks.ipynb) and includes the correct output.

**Describe the expected behavior**
The loss after 1 or 2 epochs is supposed to be around 0.3 

**Code to reproduce the issue**
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
Download the data as follows:
cd ~
mkdir Datasets
cd ~/Datasets
mkdir jena_climate
cd jena_climate
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/keras-datasets/jena_climate_2009_2016.csv.zip
unzip jena_climate_2009_2016.csv.zip

Run jupyter notebook and load the notebook in a Python 3.7 environment with tensorflow 2.0.0 as the backend and keras 2.30.
Run each cell from the beginning of the notebook so you load the data and create the generators before you get to the example under heading 1.6.  Then try to run the example.  You will find that the loss is terribly wrong.

The code under heading ""1.7 Stacking recurrent layers"" also runs incorrectly.  The loss produced is ""nan"" and val_loss is ""nan"" (both should be around 0.3).  I think it is the same problem with layers.GRU

I have reproduced this problem running tensorflow.keras in tensorflow 2.0.0.

Hello,
I collected several models in the .json format which I import using model_from_json function.
These models have different inputs and outputs (tensors) in the respective first and final layers. (Some of these models are not Sequential). In my API the user can select the input_shape and data_format coming from the flow generator. So, I need to modify the architecture shape, in order to take data in the format the user specified. However, after spending the two days looking for alternative ways I could not find an effective way of changing the architecture input layer. Keras supposed to be intuitive. xP Hereby, I'll give an example of a small model architecture generated by me and some ideas I've tried. Honestly, I really appreciate some help with this.

Model:


Goal:
Make it receive batch data in the shape (None,32,32,3), 'channels_last'
Make it output batch data in the shape (None,6)

Attempted:
1. Using set shape
 
2. Using config

3. Changing tensor directly
def changeInputsShape(model, inputs):
   assert len(model.inputs) == len(inputs), ""Model inputs and assigned inputs mismatch.""

   for i in range(len(inputs)):
     model.inputs[i] = keras.layers.Input(shape=inputs[i])

Reason:
1. set_shape only update non defined dimensions of the previously defined tensor shape.
2. setting configuration does not update input tensors themselves, compiles not run.
3. with model.build() prior to compiling: 
3. with compiling: 

Note: This is note a weights/ knowledge tranfer problem since the model is not trained so it should be relatively simpler. I guess not.

Any help would be appreciated,
Andre

Usually the GPU is used for the entirety of training and writing to logs and this is also true when . 

This [issue] (https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/3358) has been mentioned in previous questions but it is dissimilar in that their issue occurs when validation data is passed via a data generator and that histograms are not created - no reference to CPU or GPU.

As I know, the activity regularizer is the one that adding a 'norm of output' into a loss.

It is really similar to Tikhonov regularization, but is it really working well in the deep learning?

I doubt it because when differentiating the term of output norm loss with weight(w),  it becomes zero.

Actually I am not majored in Computer science, I know that I do not know that much.

So I want to ask some help know the basic principle of it.

401,keras,3721,closed,Autoencoder with 0 nodes learns something,"Hi all,

I am currently running some test with simple Autoencoders. I just copied and pasted the code from this keras blog entry: https://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html

However, when I was testing different architectures, I just found out that even an Autoencoder with zero nodes in the (well, technically not even existing) first layer appears to be learning something. The loss I get is comparable with the loss I get with bigger architectures.

Could this be a bug in the Keras autoencoder code or might this be a problem of my dataset (which is quite noisy). My intuition was that I shouldn't learn anything when using a layer with zero nodes.

Any suggestions would be very helpful!

I am assuming I will perform the first step with one graph, save the weights, and attempt to initialize a new graph with the weights learned in the first step.  The current code seems to rely upon the order of the params list when naming the weights in the hdf file.  If I want to be able to make changes to the graph that would change that order, I need a method for knowing which params to set when reloading the weights.

My current idea is to generate a unique name for each param based on the layer name, and store the params in the hdf file according to their unique names.  Then when loading the weights into the modified graph I would know which params to set.

Is this a sensible approach?  Would it break things?  Would it be compatible with all existing functionality?

I want to get the the output of lstm layer in model0. I know how to get the internal output in the simple model without merging, like:



However, the inputs of my merging model have two styles of input. Please give me some suggestions!

I am afraid that my description is too vague. In fact, I have trained the merge model via the function `train_merge_model`, which has two branches `model0`, `model1`. And get the best model. then save the best model.\n\n```\ndef train_merge_model(train_q,train_a):\n\n    print(\'Build model...\')\n    model0 = Sequential()\n    model0.add(LSTM(lstm_output_dims,input_shape=(maxlen,embedding_dims)))\n    model0.add(Dropout(0.5))\n\n    model1 = Sequential()\n    model1.add(LSTM(lstm_output_dims,input_shape=(maxlen,embedding_dims)))\n    model1.add(Dropout(0.5))\n\n    modelmerge = Sequential()\n    modelmerge.add(Merge([model0, model1], mode=\'sum\'))\n    modelmerge.add(Dropout(0.5))\n\n    modelmerge.add(Dense(1))\n    modelmerge.add(Activation(\'sigmoid\')) \n    modelmerge.compile(loss=\'mse\', optimizer=\'rmsprop\')\n\n    hist = modelmerge.fit([train_q,train_a], label, batch_size=batch_size, nb_epoch=10, verbose=1, show_accuracy=True)\n    print (hist.history)\n    cPickle.dump(modelmerge0,open(""Model\\model.pkl"",""wb"")) \n\ntrain_merge_model(train_q,train_a)\nmodelmerge = cPickle.load(open(""Model\\model.pkl"",""rb"")) \n```\n\nNow, I want to get the output of the left branch in the loaded `modelmerge`. In this merge model, there is not a model0. How can I do?\n', '@Imorton-zd ah, ok I see. Well, the short answer, then is that if you have the final modelmerge object, then model0 is:\n`modelmerge.layers[0].layers[0]`\n\nThat is layers[0] of modelmerge is the Merge([model0, model1]....) layer, which in turn has a .layers of its own, which is the same as the first argument you passed it when creating it. So model0 is at Merge([model0, mode1]...).layers[0]. \n\nThat said, you might want to consider restructuring your code. One thing to consider is to use [model saving](http://keras.io/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model). Another is to actually return model0, mergemodel from your train_merge_model method. One more is to separate model creation and model training. Keep in mind that a .load_weights() for mergemodel should also populate the weights for model0 without you needing to do anything extra. \n', '@mbotumbo Thank you for your kind help! I tried your suggested method to get the intermediate layer output from a merged model and failed.\n\nMy model design is almost the same as @Imorton-zd \'s, which merges two LSTM together.\nthe code I use is \n\n```\nimport theano\nget_feature = theano.function([net_comb.get_input(train=False)],net_comb.layers[2].get_output(train=False),allow_input_downcast=False)\nfeature = get_feature([input_3D_tra, input_3D_wea])\n```\n\nand the running result is\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File ""continue_training.py"", line 79, in <module>\n    allow_input_downcast=False)\n  File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/theano/compile/function.py"", line 307, in function\n    accept_inplace=accept_inplace, name=name)\n  File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/theano/compile/function_module.py"", line 1759, in orig_function\n    inputs = list(map(convert_function_input, inputs))\n  File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/theano/compile/function_module.py"", line 1863, in convert_function_input\n    (variable, value))\nTypeError: The value for input <TensorType(float32, 3D)> should not be a Variable or SymbolicInput instance (got: <TensorType(float32, 3D)>)\n\n```\n\nI also tried the officially suggested method which replace ""net_comb.get_input(train=False)]""  with ""[net_comb.layers[0].input]"", still got the same error.\n\nI do not know why it is illegal to use this kind of input. Could you kindly help me with this problem?\n', ""@m274d Lucky for you I ran into this one pretty recently. The issue is that .get_input(...) returns a list when  you are using a merge. The theano expect a list as the input when creating a function (which is why you have the [...] as the first argument of theano.function.). However, what it really ends up getting in this case (when you have a merge layer and use [model.get_input(...)] is something like [[input_0, input_1]], which isn't being interpreted correctly by theano.  \n\nThe fix is easy.

423,keras,2603,closed,Slow training due to 'on_batch_end()' and 'TimeDistributedDense()',"Hi,
I just finished to train my first RNN with keras, but I have two small technical problems. I have several Warning Messages because apparently something is slowing down my training phase.
The first problem is 'TimeDistributedDense()'. Apparently is deprecated and I am supposed to use 'TimeDistributed(Dense(...))' instead, as suggested by the warning msg itself. When I surf into keras documentation this method is cited in section 'Core', but the code line:

from keras.layers.core import TimeDistributed

gives me an error. How am I suposed to import TimeDistributed?

The second problem is 'on_batch_end()'. The original warning msg is the following:

Warning (from warnings module):
  File ""/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keras/callbacks.py"", line 66
    % delta_t_median)
UserWarning: Method on_batch_end() is slow compared to the batch update (0.122654). Check your callbacks

For the first, I have 100 observations - 100 X values and 100 Y values to train on. For the second, I have 200 observations - 100 X values and 100 Y values to train on.

I set up a stateful RNN with a batch size of 2. I start training on batches of 2. All is well and good for the first 100 batches. But what happens on the 101st? My batch size really needs to be 1 at this point, but I don't believe I can just change the batch size mid-training.

Is masking intelligent enough to handle this situation? So, suppose I pad my first observation with 100 sets of zeros at the beginning of my X series. I also pad its Y series with 100 zeros. I use a masking layer to mask zeros from the input data. I know masking will prevent information from the X series from being used, but will it also prevent the model from doing anything with the dummy Y values?

I suppose it would also be possible to use a batch size of 1 throughout and simply reset the model state when I'm ready to switch samples. Is there any downside to doing so (other than a little more coding overhead)?

If anyone has a decent solution except sample size, kindly let me know.', ""I used to face the same result before. I found that using smaller neural network architecture. Reason behind should be due to vanishing gradient. In some situation, your input might not carry as much information as the neural network expects, and therefore, the weights are gonna vanish to zeros even after several layers. Such problem is more serious when you are doing ConvNet, and it's the reason why we got residual network. Hope this help.  "", ""I faced the same issue when trying to implement a CNN for a multi-label comment classification problem. When I trained my model on a tiny subset of my data (say, 100 of 100000), it did what I had expected with a highly imbalanced data set - loss decreasing, accuracy going up to 1 very quickly, validation accuracy a little lower, but also changing pretty fast. But when I used a bigger subset, my model seemed to get 'stuck' at a certain accuracy. It also predicted 'nan' for all test samples and labels. \r\n\r\n**What finally solved the problem for me** was applying (sigmoid) activation to my 1D convolutional layer (there was only one in my model at that point). I hadn't used any activation at first. I also set kernel_initializer to random_normal, but I think the crucial part was the activation.\r\n\r\nEverything else I had tried before that (different activation on the other layers, manipulating the learning rate, gradient clipping, balancing out my dataset) didn't make any difference.  \r\n\r\nLooking at the other examples I see nobody made the same mistake - using a convolutional layer without activation - but who knows, maybe my experience could be helpful for someone in the future. "", ""I 'm not sure but I solved this problem. I used Keras for CNN model on the Kaggle platform with GPU.     \r\nI took the same problems all epoch step had same val_loss and val_acc.

431,keras,6296,closed,"What's the difference between ""samples_per_epoch"" and ""steps_per_epoch""","Hello everyone, I was confused by this problem for several days...

My question is that why the training time has such massive difference between that I set the batch_size to be ""1"" and ""20"" for my generator.

If I set the **_batch_size_** to be **1**, the **training time** of _**1 epoch**_ is approximately **180 ~ 200 sec**.
If I set the **_batch_size_** to be **20**, the **training time** of **1 epoch** is approximately **3000 ~ 3200 sec**. 

However, this horrible difference between these training times seems to be abnormal..., since it should be the reversed result:
batch_size = 1, training time -> 3000 ~ 3200 sec.
batch_size = 20, training time -> 180 ~ 200 sec.

The input to my generator is not the file path, but the numpy arrays which are already loaded into the
memory via calling ""np.load()"".
So I think the I/O trade-off issue doesn't exist.

I'm using Keras-2.0.3 and my backend is tensorflow-gpu 1.0.1

I have seen the update of this merged [PR](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/5879/files),
but it seems that this change won't affect anything at all. (the usage is just the same with original one)

The [link](https://gist.github.com/HappyStorm/cb6c22ffec18a8fbb4912e9c79b6d87c) here is the gist of my self-defined generator and the part of my fit_generator.

Thank you :)",type:support,"[""Hello Murugan R, in your case the model was trained to classify only 10 classes (i.e. the number of units in the output layer is 10). Now that you've added a new class, you have 11 classes so you've to change the output units of the last layer to 11 and then you can maybe load the same weights for all layers except output layer and freeze the weights but use new weights for output layer and retrain the network. Note that this may or may not work because earlier layers may not know how to interpret features for the newly added label.\r\nFurther reading on this topic: https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/alexa/post/6058f7e9-1de8-4e51-8f50-aee56e29f3ce/updating-neural-networks-to-recognize-new-categories-with-minimal-retraining"", '@MuruganR96 Adding on top of @dabasajay , if the original model was trained for classifying 10 different classes of images of dog breeds, you can add one more class in the end (11 breeds instead of 10) and train with your data to update weights for the last layer. But, if you want to use the original model  (classifying 10 dog breeds) for classifying X-ray images (entirely different from the actual purpose of the original model) of 11 classes, then you need to train few more layers in the end and then train with your data.

## Way to force keras calling tensorflow in GPU or CPUs
###  run keras in CPU


### run keras in GPU
I don't write anything, let everything be as default. So since I install tensorflow in GPU version. It should assume default using GPU.


This undocumented trick works for me so far. However, since keras is a blackbox to me, while tensorflow is more structured and clear, I feel there should be an improvement for keras to better control the CPU/GPU device **with in keras**. I know we could just use keras as simplified tensorflow layer constructor. Thus it is possible to run everything under framework of tensorflow rather than living in the world of keras.

If you have alternative ways to force keras be used in CPU or GPU, please comment below and let everyone else know.

450,keras,2586,closed,Mixture Density Network quickly gets to nan loss,"Hello,

I've got the latest pulls of keras and theano.

I am trying to reproduce the code from [this blog post](http://cbonnett.github.io/MDN.html).

What I have so far is in a gist [here](https://gist.github.com/sergeyf/cf20b2759a7d38035f30384769bed9df).

The issue is that after a few batch updates (on the order of 10), the loss becomes nan.

Here is a repaste of the most likely culprit: the negative log-likelihood loss function:



I've tried to alter various parts of this function, and can't spot any specific issues.

I've added the log-sum-exp trick to prevent underflow in there, and when I check out values of each intermediate variable within the loss function during any of the batches before the nan loss, they all seem very well behaved.

Any ideas?

Thanks for your help, and the fabulous package.

It seems that you can't make the hidden unit and the output units of a SimpleRNN layer have diffﾃｩrent values.

466,keras,1761,closed,validation accuracy superior to training accuracy,"Hi,
I'm working on a deep neural network (Sequential Dense), but i don't understand why the training accuracy is lower than the validation accuracy (the two sets being separated and having roughly the same distribution).
I started working on machine learning not so long ago and i was told that a way(the only one i know) to check if my network is not overfitting is to compare validation and train accuracy. If validation accuracy start dropping while the training accuracy continue to increase that's when i should be concerned.
Problem is validation accuracy is higher than training accuracy which doesn't make any sense for me...

I'm sure i missed something somewhere (maybe the training accuracy displayed by keras is not the one i think of) or the way i put my validation data is not the good one... Or maybe am I just wrong all along.
So if any one could give me an advice, or knows if there is a way to plot or visualize the data training within Keras to prevent overfit that would help.

I'm talking about that kind of thing (i'm copy pasting a random epoch but all are roughly the same):

",,"['Check the following things when training any type of deep neural network:\n1. the data used to calculate training accuracy is not identical to the data used to train your NN. This sounds weird, but possible in practice, especially in case of images, if you don\'t keep track of what is happening. For example, you train on random patches of images and calculate training accuracy on _random_ patches of same images. It is easy to forget that though they are same images, the patches are randomly selected.\n2. More than the values of train and val accuracy, I would be concerned about what you said, ""i\'m copy pasting a random epoch but all are roughly the same"". No, they can\'t be same. Accuracy at different epochs is mostly different, because network is learning so it is constantly changing its weights. If accuracy goes up then that means it is approaching the minima of the loss function.\n3. I think you should be more concerned about getting a low training accuracy instead of getting a lower training accuracy than the validation accuracy.\n4. Do all the sanity checks given [here](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/#gradcheck). Read the entire article if possible, it\'s very good.\n5. Make sure you are doing pre-processing in the right manner. For example, make sure that mean over entire training data is zero. For testing data, subtract the mean vector of the training data from each instance of testing data. Don\'t subtract the mean of testing data from itself. Since, you wouldn\'t know the mean of testing data at runtime.\n6. Check if your loss at the very first epoch makes sense. For example, in a 10-class classification problem, starting loss should be -ln(0.1) = 2.302 (given [here](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/#gradcheck)). \n7. Again, from [here](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/#gradcheck), overfit a tiny subset of data and make sure you can achieve zero cost. Full details in the link.\n8. If nothing works, just train and test on the same data and see if you can get 90% + accuracy. Otherwise, examine your network more closely by looking at individual layer outputs (given in Keras FAQ) etc.\n\nI am sure you will find the fault somewhere if you follow all these steps for debugging a neural network.\n', ""If your validation set is small and you're still underfitting, you can sometimes get higher validation accuracy just by random chance. Usually this will go away as you train more.\n"", ""I've been tracking the ratio of the training loss to the validation loss.  For me, the ratio starts off quite above 1 and slowly converges to 1 over time.\n\nI don't know if you are using dropout, but in thinking about why my validation loss is lower than the training loss, I am considering this to be a key reason.  The training loss is based upon the specific randomly selected dropped-out network for that record, which is much less likely to be well tuned than the loss when using the full network (with adjusted weights) on the validation data.\n"", 'This is also answered in the [FAQ](http://keras.io/faq/#why-is-the-training-loss-much-higher-than-the-testing-loss)\n', ""@rpinsler Yes sorry i didn't see it,  the use of dropout indeeds make the training accuracy lower than it should be.\nAnd thanks to you @parag2489 for all thoses advices and the reading, helped me a lot.\n"", ""I am also facing the same issue.

474,keras,3037,closed,Implement custom layer with multiple inputs which is input layer and has trainable weights,"I'm implementing a custom layer. When I try to call it using the following code it gives me an error. Is this the right way to implement a layer with multiple inputs? Also the code in the call function of the layer is using some theano.Tensor functions instead of the functions given in keras backend. Does this mean I won't be able to use this with a functional api anymore?

I'm not pointing a problem, I'm just wondering how I can manage to do what I want. I explain myself : 
For an image X, the Y that I want to predict is a couple of numpy array [Y1, Y2]. Y1 is (38, 60, 18) shaped and Y2 is (38, 60, 72) shaped. As I am working with a big dataset, I would like to use the train_on_batch function. However, this function should take a numpy array of X  values (which is not a problem) and a numpy array of Y values. Because Y1 and Y2 are not of the same shape, I can't stack them into a single array, and using a list raise an exception because train_on_batch calls the Y shape. Does anyone has an idea about how I can trick that ?

A metric function is similar to an loss function, except that the results from evaluating a metric are not used when training the model. You can find from this url: https://keras.io/metrics/', ""@wqp89324 Another way to put it, expanding on @jhli973's answer, is that the evaluation metric is what you as the _researcher_ will use to judge the model's performance (on training, test, and/or evaluation data); it's the bottom line number that you would publish. The loss function is what the _network_ will use to try to improve itself, hopefully in a way that leads to improved evaluation for the researcher's sake. For example, in a binary classification problem, the network might train using a binary crossentropy loss function with gradient descent, whereas the modeler's goal is to design a network to improve binary category accuracy on hold-out data."", ""It looks like many of the helpful metrics that used to be supported [have been removed](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/wiki/Keras-2.0-release-notes) with Keras 2.0.

According to @fchollet, he explained in #5794 that it was intentionally [removed](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/commit/a56b1a55182acf061b1eb2e2c86b48193a0e88f7)  in [version 2.0](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/wiki/Keras-2.0-release-notes) because it performs only approximation by batchwise evaluation.

This is very helpful. I have a follow up question.\r\n\r\nWhile using ""predict_generator"", How to ensure that the prediction is done on all test samples once.\r\n\r\nFor example-\r\npredictions = model.predict_generator(\r\ntest_generator,\r\nsteps=int(test_generator.samples/float(batch_size)), # all samples once\r\nverbose = 1,\r\nworkers = 2,\r\nmax_q_size=10,\r\npickle_safe=True\r\n)\r\npredicted_classes = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)\r\ntrue_classes = test_generator.classes\r\n\r\nSo the dimensions of predicted_classes and true_classes is different since total samples is not divisible by batch size.\r\n\r\nThe size of my test_set is not consistent, so the no. of steps in predict_generator would change each time depending upon the batch size. I am using flow_from_directory and cannot use predict_on_batch since my data is organized in a directory structure.\r\n\r\nOne solution is running with batch size of 1, but makes it very slow.\r\n\r\nI hope my question is clear. Thanks in advance.', ""@sxs4337 I am happy to tell you, that you don't have to worry about that, when using the ImageDataGenerator, as it automatically takes care of the last batch, if your samples are not divisible by the batch size. For example, if you have 10 samples and a minibatch-size of 4, `test_generator` will create batches of the following size: 4, 4, 2. Consecutive next()-calls will repeat the sequence from the beginning. \r\n\r\nBy using `test_steps_per_epoch = numpy.math.ceil(test_data_generator.samples / test_data_generator.batch_size)` you automatically will get 3 batches for the example from above, which will result in a total of 10 predictions."", '@apacha \r\nThank you for the reply.

496,keras,8827,closed,[help wanted] Input shape / target size flow from directory,"Hi,
iﾂｴm wondering about the correct input_shape and/or target_size when using fit_generator and flow_from_directory. Iﾂｴm running keras 2.0.8-tf and tensorflow 1.4 as the backend. My images have the following dimensions:

width: 725 Pixel
height: 180 Pixel
channels: 3

I define the Input_shape as: (width, height, channels) --> (725,180,3), as it is suggested when using tensorflow as the backend.

I use the ImageDataGenerator with the flow_from_directory method to get the training data. Here the target_size may be specified. The target_size can be either (width, height) or (height, width). The API is defining it as (height, width). 

And now the Problem occurs. If the Input_shape is (width, height, channels) and the target_size is (heigth, width) - as it should be - a ValueError is raised, saying the shapes donﾂｴt match (Error when checking input: expected conv2d_1_input to have shape (None, 725, 180, 3) but got array with shape (50, 180, 725, 3)).

If i set the target_size to (width, height), the training is starting, but if i then plot an Image using the Generator, i see that width and height are exchanged and hence the Image is massively transformed.

How to solve this issue? In fchollets great [example](https://gist.github.com/fchollet/0830affa1f7f19fd47b06d4cf89ed44d) the target_size is also set the other way around as in the API.

504,keras,3048,closed,Classification using 1D and 2D Conv net for time series data with multiple features,"Hi, 

Am trying to solve a classification problem using time series/ Sequential data using CNN.
I have created some features using simple mathematical transformation from same data. 
Following are the things I tried.
1. 1D conv net with features as multiple row
2. 2D conv net with single channel and features as rows( Filter nb_rows =1)
3. 2D conv net with channel = number of features(Filter nb_rows =1)

I want to know what would be the correct approach. 

My understanding is as follows:
1. 1D conv net with multiple rows net treats each row as different information. 
2. 2D with 1 channel and multiple rows with filter nb_rows=1 should behave same as 1D conv net with multiple rows
3. 2D conv net with features as different channels help to learn new abstractions.

Appreciate your comments on which approach fits best theoritically.

Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue. Thank you!

It\'s about the implementation of Adam and RMSProp etc in Tensorflow. When the model finds good weights on the first day it creates small losses, and Adam and other optimizers with a given learning rate ignores the previously adapted (and probably smaller) learning rate, and restarts the learning with the issue described below (basically: low errors are handled with a small epsilon). So saving the adapted learning rate could help too.\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/ibab/tensorflow-wavenet/issues/143](https://github.com/ibab/tensorflow-wavenet/issues/143)\r\n\r\nlet me quote here:\r\n\r\nExplanation\r\n\r\nI\'ve seen the behavior Zeta36 is describing in our test/test_model.py. When that test uses adam or rmsprop, I would see the loss drop and drop till a small number, then jump up to a large loss at some random time.\r\n\r\nYou can reproduce that problematic behavior if you change (what at the time of this writing in master) MomentumOptimizer to AdamOptimizer, make the learning rate 0.002 and delete the momentum parameter. Uncomment the statements that print loss.\r\n\r\nIf you run the test with\r\n\r\npython test/test_model.py\r\n\r\nevery second or third time or so that you run the test you will see the loss will drop and then at some point jump up to a larger value, and sometimes cause the test to fail. I ""worked around"" that problem by futzing with the learn rate and number of training iterations we run in the test until it would reliably pass.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think I\'ve found the cause. If you look at the tensorflow implementations of rmsprop and adam you will see they compute the change to a weight by dividing by a sinister lag-filtered rate-of-change or error magnitude. When the error or rate of change of error gets small, or even zero, near the bottom of the error basin, then the denominator gets close to zero. The only thing saving us from a NaN or Inf is they add an epsilon in the denominator. That epsilon defaults to 1e-10 for rmsprop and 1e-8 for adam. That\'s enough to make the change to our parameter a big number, presumably big enough give us a large loss.\r\n\r\nSo in PR 128 I specified a larger epsilon for rmsprop, and in PR 147 for adam. I found that these changes fix the problem of randomly increasing loss during the tests in test_model.py.\r\n', ""I just read through this and I have the same issue (Adam optimizer).

Here is a gist of the issue and the log: https://gist.github.com/aachkar-miovision/89daac9ce598dbcb5a698612a3a42684

In my use case, it is not possible to load all the images into a single numpy array as in the cifar10_cnn fit_generator example, so I have to resort to loading images in batches from within my own ImageDataGenerator. I use cv2 because I perform different transforms involving color conversion, etc., so I load the images for a batch using cv2.imread(). 

With small images, I did not see this issue, but my images are on the order of 480x720 pixels and I do see it with images on that size (related to time it takes to read the image?). 

A possible fix would be to also check for AttributeError at https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/engine/training.py#L399

Is there a reason that this line only checks for ValueError?

So far what I found out is that an RNN receives 3D tensor with shape of (batch_size, timesteps, dimension) and when you set input_shape the batch_size is usually omitted, and you should just provide a tuple of (timesteps, dimension). But how exactly do I write that in my code??
",stale,"['`timesteps`  usually indicate the length of your sequence (each sample should have same length, or you should do some paddings of your input to have the same length)\n`dimension` usually indicate the number of units in a specific layer. for e.g. if your word embedding is 100 dimension, then you just set this param as 100.\n', 'Your code is good.

520,keras,9232,closed,Use LSTM for recurrent convolutional network without time distributed wrapper,"I am facing an issue with a project I'm currently working on. I am attempting to build a many-to-many model that takes a series of images and classifies them. That part is relatively straight forward. I have a model built using Keras that uses convolutional layers inside the time distributed wrapper that feed into an LSTM and it works fine. The complexity in my current project comes from the fact that this model needs to be converted to CoreML for deployment. I feel I'm up against a wall with this so any help provided would be a life saver.

Like I said previously, my current model is trainable using the time distributed wrapper, but this doesn't seem to be supported by CoreML. I have seen some examples using an LSTM with CoreML where the LSTM states are passed in and out of the model with each item in the sequence. This essentially creates a recurrent network that takes only a single item from the sequence (as well as the previous predictions LSTM states) as an input, rather than the whole sequence at once. That LSTM state loop (for lack of a better term) seems to be the best option as CoreML doesn't support sequential image inputs. My issue then comes from training. How can I train my network properly on sequential data, then convert it to CoreML?

If I remove the time distribution from the non-LSTM layers, the model won't compile because it's missing the extra time dimension. Essentially, the catch here is I can't remove the time distribution wrappers as the model isn't functional without the inclusion of time steps, and I can't convert to CoreML while they are present.

Does anyone have any ideas on how to do this? I hope this question is understandable. It's quite late and I've been working on this for 20+ hours straight so I'm a bit fried at the moment. Thanks in advance for any input, thoughts, or ideas provided. Cheers!

My model:

    image_input = Input(shape=(max_sequence_length, 224, 224, 3))
    
    convolutional_1 = TimeDistributed(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', data_format = 'channels_last'))(image_input)
    pooling_1 = TimeDistributed(MaxPooling2D((2, 2), strides=(1, 1)(convolutional_1)

    convolutional_2 = TimeDistributed(Conv2D(128, (4,4), activation='relu'))(pooling_1)
    pooling_2 = TimeDistributed(MaxPooling2D((2, 2), strides=(2, 2)))(convolutional_2)

    convolutional_3 = TimeDistributed(Conv2D(256, (4,4), activation='relu'))(pooling_2)
    pooling_3 = TimeDistributed(MaxPooling2D((2, 2), strides=(2, 2)))(convolutional_3)

    flatten_1 = TimeDistributed(Flatten())(pooling_3)
    dropout_1 = TimeDistributed(Dropout(0.5))(flatten_1)

    lstm_1 = LSTM(256, return_sequences=True, return_state=False, stateful=False, dropout=0.5)(dropout_1)

    dense_1 = TimeDistributed(Dense(num_classes, activation='sigmoid'))(lstm_1)

    model = Model(inputs = image_input, outputs = dense_1)


I wanted to add that I have seen some posts where it seems people were using time distribution wrappers with CoreML, however when I try to convert my model it raises this error as soon as it hits the first wrapper:

""AttributeError: The layer has never been called and thus has no defined output shape.""

I have modified the conversion script for Keras -> CoreML to handle a 4D input (although I haven't been able to test it to see if it works as expected as I can't convert my model) for the image sequence, so if I can get it to convert with the time distribution layers in place, it would be functional.

I just upgrade my Keras to latest version and getting a error related to keras/engine/training on the code that used to work fine beforehand (my previous version was 2.1.0). I am not sure if it's some kind of deprectation or etc.

522,keras,3538,closed,How to reset keras random state many times inside python?,"For generating different initial random state for neural network I have been doing this based on 
suggestions in the forum:

import numpy as np ;
import datetime ; 
np.random.seed(datetime.datetime.now().microsecond)
from keras import ....

(setting numpy random seed before importing anything from keras). 

Now, assume that I want to train/evaluate a neural network with different initial random states, 
for 10 times, and take average of f-scores. I had to run the file externally for 10 times (e.i., python myprog.py) to make it work. 

Now assume I want to this inside python:

for i in range(10):
         import numpy as np ;
         import datetime ; 
         np.random.seed(datetime.datetime.now().microsecond)
         from keras import ....
         train()
         evaluate()

but I guess this will not do it, because keras is already imported. 
does **del np, del keras**, inside the function works? 
does **reload (np), reload (keras)** works ? 

**What is the correct way of doing this?**

I've looked at similar issues on Theano/Keras github issues page. 
Almost all the solutions pointed towards updating Theano & Keras.

Could someone please help me out in fixing this.

535,keras,5990,closed,Keras API ,"I am new to Keras so maybe I just don't know it better yet but there are a few things I noticed.

For example  changes its return type from a scalar to a list depending on whether the network has just one or many outputs. If I wanted to create something more generic that handles both cases, I am forced to perform type-checking operation on my end. This is why I wanted to ask whether it was possible to change thing like this and simply _always_ return a list.

Something similar, but way worse, happens when one changes the model inputs from single, to multi channel. I noticed that I have to change because in a single-input network I might hand in a  matrix whereas this changes to a  for each input where each list has to contain the data for each channel etc. Imho it would be easier to simply _always_ demand a list because that way you do not run into the issue where you have to re-write your batch generation logic. 

This is not a complaint. I love Keras and I think it's awesome and please forgive me if I am wrong with what I suggest here but if not it would be great to keep such things in mind.

And since I am on it .. I noticed that _a lot_ of questions are getting asked here on github. A lot of questions that would also fit to stackoverflow. I am not sure why but wouldn't it be better to enforce this as some point by close all new issues and ask the people to move their general questions to stackoverflow?

In this setup, the error appears when using `dropout_W` or `dropout_U` in the GRU.\n\nNot specifying `batch_size` is not possible here, since [these lines in the TimeDistributed() layer](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/layers/wrappers.py#L133-L145) wouldn\'t make much sense with an RNN.\n', '@farizrahman4u as i reported in https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/4182\n1. batch_size is required when using stateful rnn\n2. what i want to get in timedistributed(dropout) is _not_ the same dropout nodes for every timestep, but having every timestep drop exactly x% of nodes. without timedistributed you would get different fractions for different timesteps\n', '@sjebbara There is no reason for you to provide the `batch_size` unless you are having a stateful RNN.

I think it may be that the pretrained model was trained additionally with a scaling factor to normalize it to [0,1], but the preprocessing function only gives us the mean so we know which means to subtract to center the data. I'd recommend you check if your scaling makes sense; a bad scaling of inputs into a Neural Network may cause your updates to either move very slowly (i.e. the derivative of the sigmoid function beyond -3 and +3 are near 0 and so your gradients are almost 0), or if you're using something like the ReLU function, the updates may be big (the derivative is 1) and a wrong update makes you jump pass the local minima very easily.\r\n\r\nALSO, if you're rescaling in python 2, make sure you have that dot in 1/255., or else all your inputs will be multiplied by 0 and you aren't making any updates!!!"", 'sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits may encounters the gradients explosion problem, try using clip_gradients.', ""In my case, It is the normalization problem:\r\n(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()\r\nx_train = x_train.astype('float32')\r\nx_test = x_test.astype('float32')\r\n\r\nx_train /= 255 \r\nx_test /= 255  # normalization [0, 255]--->[0, 1]"", 'I am trying to Create DNN but it is not converging, any idea\r\nmodel = Sequential()\r\nmodel.add(Dense(5000, input_dim=5, activation=\'relu\', kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.1)))\r\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.1))\r\nmodel.add(Dense(2000, kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.1),activation=\'relu\'))\r\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.1))\r\nmodel.add(Dense(400, kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.1),activation=\'relu\'))\r\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.1))\r\nmodel.add(Dense(1,activation=\'relu\'))\r\n\r\n\r\nrmsprop = optimizers.RMSprop(lr=0.01, rho=0.7, epsilon=1e-8, decay=0.0)\r\nsgd = optimizers.SGD(lr=0.001, decay=1e-6, momentum=0.4, nesterov=True)\r\nmodel.compile(loss=\'mse\', optimizer=\'adam\', metrics=[""mae""])\r\ncallbacks = [EarlyStopping(monitor=\'val_loss\', patience=5),\r\n             ModelCheckpoint(filepath=\'DNN_Adam.h5\', monitor=\'val_loss\', save_best_only=True)]\r\nnp.random.seed(3)\r\nhistory=model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=500 , batch_size=5000, validation_split=0.1, verbose=2,callbacks=callbacks)\r\nTrain on 16109 samples, validate on 1790 samples\r\nEpoch 1/500\r\n -

564,keras,3425,closed,Sudden accuracy drop when training LSTM or GRU,"Hi! My **recurrent neural network (LSTM, resp. GRU)** behaves in a way I cannot explain. The training starts and it trains well (the results look quite good) when **suddenly accuracy drops (and loss rapidly increases)** - both training and testing metrics. Sometimes the net just _goes crazy_ and returns random outputs and sometimes (as in the last of three given examples) it starts to return _same output to all the inputs_.

Do you have **any explanation for this behavior**? Any opinion is welcome. Please, see the task description and the figures below.

**The task:** From a word predict its word2vec vector
**The input:** We have an own word2vec model (normalized) and we feed the network with a word (letter by letter). We pad the words (see the example below).
**Example:** We have a word _football_ and we want to predict its word2vec vector which is 100 dimensions wide. Then the input is . 

Three examples of the behavior:

**Single layer LSTM**

576,keras,2003,closed,Loss increasing after each epoch.,"I'm using Keras to build and train a recurrent neural network.



 is an an array of sequences of [latitude, longitude, temperature], all padded to the same length with values of [0,0,0]. When I train this network, the first epoch gives me a loss of about 63, and _increases_ after more epochs.
This is causing a  call later in the code to give values that are completely off of the training values. For example, most of the training values in each sequence is around , but the RNN outputs values consistently around , which causes me to think something is wrong with the masking layer.

I'm trying to use custom data on the LSTM model, but it keeps giving shape errors.

592,keras,5167,closed,Merge layer with lambda - potential issue with reloading model after save,"Hi, I have a model which uses a Merge() layer. The model runs and saves. I am having trouble loading the model again.



The error I get is:

> arg 5 (closure) must be None or tuple

After researching some previous issues, I saw that other people had potentially similar issues using the _Lambda()_. But I didn't get whether there was a solution to this. 

I am running into this issue with both Python 2.7/3.5


Update:

I changed the merge layer. Lambda now takes only one argument, and the output shape is literally defined:

 where  is a list of output layers from models being merged.

Now, when I try to load the model, the error is:

> The layer has never been called and thus it has no defined output shape

Any help would be appreciated.

594,keras,4966,closed,"How to crop ""dinamically""","I'm trying to implement the following architecture with Keras (Theano backend). 

I have a first Sequential network (say S1) which takes an image as input and has 4 linear output, which do correspond to the upper-left and the bottom-right coordinates of a rectangular ""window"" in the input image which is supposed to contain the object I want to identify. 

Once I have those four outputs... I'd like to actually crop the image!

So I thought to take again my image as input in a new Sequential network (say S2) and merge these two networks using a Merge Layer with function mode.

I turned out to be a bit more complicated than I expected and I'm stuck with some Theano errors I can't get rid of.

Here's the relevant part of the code:


    model1 = Sequential()
    model1.add(Convolution2D(64, 3, 3, border_mode='same', input_shape=(1280, 720, 3), activation='relu'))
    # now model.output_shape == (None, 1280, 720, 64)

    # add a 3x3 convolution on top, with 32 output filters:
    model1.add(Convolution2D(32, 3, 3, border_mode='same',activation='relu'))
    # now model.output_shape == (None, 1280, 720, 32)
    model1.add(Flatten())
    model1.add(Dense(4, activation='linear'))

    model2 = Sequential()
    # How can I create a simple ""input"" net?
    model2.add(Reshape((1280, 720, 3), input_shape=(1280, 720, 3)))

    def merger(l):
        image = l[1]
        indexes = l[0]
        index_0 = indexes[:][0]
        index_1 = indexes[:,1]
        index_2 = indexes[:,2]
        index_3 = indexes[:,3]
        cropped_image = image[:,index_0:index_1+1, index_2:index_3+1,:]
        return cropped_image

    merged_model = Sequential()
    merged_model.add(Merge([model1, model2], mode=merger))

And here you have the error:

What's going on?",stale,"[""Just a thought, but without any kind of checks (e.g. negative check, left/right must be less than right/bottom) you can wind up with a slice like `image[:, 5:2, 6:-1, :]` which would wind up with a generic shape of `(None, 0, 714, 3)`.\r\n\r\nI don't think that has to do with your error, as the above shape with a 0 dimension is valid. But you should check out some examples of the Merge layer, especially with a custom mode, because at the very least you will also need to supply a function for `output_shape` since you are using a custom mode.\r\n\r\nI'd recommend getting it working without doing the cropping first (e.g. just return the image in your merger) as you'll need to do the `output_shape` function as well, and then add in the actual cropping."", ""Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, you're going to run into issues whenever you have `batch_size` > 1. Tensors are essentially multidimensional matrices, so you can't have subtensors of mismatched dimensions. In other words, you can't really combine tensors of shapes (851, 254, 3) and (498, 387, 3) automatically, you would have to pad up to (851, 387, 3) and probably keep a reference list of the valid areas; so depending on what you are trying to do, it will probably just be better to keep the full images plus the diagonal corner info, and not do any cropping. But again, that's dependent on what you are trying to accomplish."", ""Of course I'll have to implement checks to get a valid window (left corner to the left of the right corner, etc.) but that's not the problem here because the error I posted was raised before any attempt of training, that's why I have not supplied an output_shape function in my issue.\r\n\r\nBut actually I had not foreseen the batch_size problem... Getting around it could be complicated."", 'Fair enough, but I still recommend starting smaller.\r\n\r\nThat said, your error is `ValueError: (\'TensorType could not be cast to have 0 dimensions\', TensorType(float32, vector))`. This says that a float32 vector could not be cast to a 0 dimensional item. Looking at the code, and simplifying to a minimal slice attempt:\r\n```python\r\ndef merger(l):\r\n    image = l[1]\r\n    indexes = l[0]\r\n    index_0 = indexes[:,0]\r\n    return image[:, index_0:, :, :]\r\n```\r\n..still throws this error. We can now say that slicing by index_0 is the issue; index_0 is a slice of shape (None, 1), which is a vector. Trying to slice by a vector is nonsensical in Theano, as it expects the slicer index (index_0) to be an integer, which is a 0 dimensional item. So, the error in English is saying: ""Expected an integer, got a vector of floats; cannot cast a vector of floats to an integer.\r\n\r\nIn other words, your issues are:\r\n\r\n- The output of model 1 is float32s, which should be typecasted to integers if you want to use them to slice anything (small issue, but if you got the below issue fixed, you\'d still wind up with an ""Indexes must be integers"" error).\r\n- Tensors are matrices, and you can\'t slice the subtensors into different sizes using a vector\r\n\r\nSo, your options are:\r\n\r\n- code everything as if you\'ll have only a `batch_size` of 1, and can therefore index using 4 integers.

I have a convolution network with a 1-channel 2D input.
This input layer is shared by two nodes, each performing some convolution operations.
Then outputs of the two nodes are merged by another node, which produces the final output.

Perhaps the callback constructor should have an optional `history` parameter that can be used to correctly initialize the learning rate and the `wait` variable (see https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/ab3b93e8dd103f1d9729305825791a084c7c8493/keras/callbacks.py#L744)\r\n"", 'Besides using the `initial_epoch` argument of `fit`, I re-wrote the history callback:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass History(Callback):\r\n    """"""\r\n    Callback that records events into a `History` object.\r\n\r\n    This callback is automatically applied to\r\n    every Keras model.

After installation of all packages and specifically Keras and Theano backend, I am able to call under Python (Ubuntu 14:04  - Python version 2.7.6) all packages nicely.

So, as example, when I interactively do call up Python and then import keras, I get the standard print 'Using Theano backend.' as desired and set in the keras.json file

Now, I installed flask server and and apache2 server working with wsgi package.
I test this server out with several types of routes and returns and all is working nicley.

my flask file is looking essentially like



my predict.py file is in the python directory and looks like



so, I start my apache server and look at the logs and the logs tell me 
'Using TensorFlow backend.' which is not what I want.

Can anybody give me a hint why this is happening

**Describe the current behavior**  
If I set all the random seeds, use only the CPU, disable CPU multiprocessing, and I run the same experiment 10 times, the loss of the second  call comes out as one of two different values each time.

**Describe the expected behavior**  
The loss should be bit-perfect reproducible in this situation.

Check the reproducibility with the following command:

    for i in  ; do python3 code_example.py 2>/dev/null | tail -n 1 ; done

**Other info / logs**


There are a variety of things which affect whether or not the training is bit-perfect reproducible:
 - The loss is always consistent after the first .  Training for three steps exhibits identical behavior to training for two steps (all losses come out to one of two values)
 - Commenting out various layers restores reproducibility (see comments in code example)
 - Eliminating the decay from  optimizer (or using  optimizer with decay) restores reproducibility
 - Metric selection affects reproducibility.  Some metrics break reproducibility when included twice, one metric,  breaks reproducibility when included at all.
 - I noticed no change in behavior when I used the git master branch.
 - Inserting a  into the graph, while using the RMSprop with decay, will restore reproducibility.  Patch:

I have used a model (provided [here](https://medium.com/@ksusorokina/image-classification-with-convolutional-neural-networks-496815db12a8)] that trains a model on two categories of pictures and then tries to classify them.
Furthermore, I force the network to use the same seeds when training so as to get comparable results. I also create and close the tf sessions as I have read that this may also cause problems.

**Describe the current behaviour** 
Most of the time the test and validation accuracy converge around 0.5 and the loss stays at exactly the same value for every epoch. I can run the same code, without changing it, several times in a row and get this problem and only rarely do I get a run where the neural network is trained properly and rises to and above 0.9 accuracy for training and validation.


**Describe the expected behaviour**  
For the same seeds the run should produce at least very similar results i.e. it should not be stuck around 0.5 accuracy.

**Code to reproduce the issue**  


[Edit]
I've tried a [different tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-image-classification-using-keras/) and I get the same result. The only changes I have done to the code is to change the image dimension to the size of my images, changed the image directories and to turn off Image Augmentation, as well as changed the number of images.

About half of my runs produced output such as this

while the other half produced 

(the numbers were not always exactly the same).

I though that maybe I have bad images so I tried use images from other tutorials (like [this](https://github.com/perseus784/BvS)) but I got the same results: about half or more of the runs are useless because they converge at 0.5 accuracy.

645,keras,4395,closed,[Question] Graph Machines in keras,"Hello,
I'm not sure if this is the proper place to ask a question about keras. I apologize in advance if it is not.

 I'm currently trying to reproduce this publication which is using recurrent neural nets to predict chemical activities.

> Goulon, A., T. Picot, A. Duprat, and G. Dreyfus. 窶弃redicting Activities without Computing Descriptors: Graph Machines for QSAR.窶 SAR and QSAR in Environmental Research 18, no. 1窶2 (January 1, 2007): 141窶53. doi:10.1080/10629360601054313.

In two words : the autors represent a molecule as a directed acyclic graph. Each node of this graph being an atom and each edge being a chemical bond. Then a neural network is applied on the ""exit node"" (called root node in the publication). This neural network calls itself on the parents of the root node and so on to provide a prediction on the whole molecule.

I think I understand how the training works for this graph machine: for each molecule, a gradient of the cost function is calculated by backpropagation in the molecule. The gradient over a batch of molecules is a weighted average of the gradient calculated for each molecule composing the batch. 
A gradient descent algorithm is then used to minimize the cost-function.

My main trouble is : how can I implement this training procedure in Keras ? Usually, you just provide a list of X and a list of corresponding Y and just use model.compile() and then model.fit(). From what I understand, it is not possible here because each molecule should have its own keras.model

Is keras even the best solution here ?

### Change 1: ImageDataGenerator can be exhaused

The [documentation of ImageDataGenerator](https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/) says:

> Generate batches of tensor image data with real-time data augmentation. The data will be looped over (in batches) indefinitely.

It seems to me that, this (loops indefinitely) implies that, the image data generator is mainly used for the training process, and not for the final test (because we only need one epoch when testing).

Sure you can achieve the one epoch purpose by using , but this relies on the implementation of  and is not a documented behaviour.

I propose:

1. Add an  keyword argument that controls  whether the iterator yields indefinitely or not.

2. Alternative to 1, we can also make the  mentioned above a documented behaviour, and also document that after the final step, each image is visited exactly once.

### Change 2: Add a new  to yields the filenames of the batch

The current implementation of  allows you to recover the current batch's filenames by using its  and  property, but this relies on the implementation and is not documented.

I propose we add a new  to yields the filenames of the current batch, just like we don't let user slice its  property to get the current batch's class. (The filename is useful at least for making some Kaggle submissions).

667,keras,5191,closed,Fix K.rnn documentation on unroll parameter,"**Edit**

Docs state the below, but unroll is a parameter used by both backends.

> unroll: with TensorFlow the RNN is always unrolled, but with Theano you can use this boolean flag to unroll the RNN.

For theano backend we use scan but for tf we use while_loop, even through tf also supports scan. Also, does anyone know if using scan instead of while_loop has any performance or other benefits?
